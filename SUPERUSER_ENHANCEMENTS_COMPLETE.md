  - Start/expire timestamps
  - Creator tracking

- ✅ Pagination (20 per page)
- ✅ Create/edit/delete announcements

### 3. Routes & Integration

#### **Backend Route (`server/routes.ts`)**
```typescript
import announcementsRoutes from './routes/announcements';
app.use('/api/announcements', announcementsRoutes);
```
