## 🐛 Issues Fixed This Session

### PostgreSQL Column Naming Error
**File:** `server/routes/daos.ts` (lines 80-88)

**Before:**
```typescript
SELECT "daoId" ... FILTER (WHERE "joinedAt" >= ...) GROUP BY "daoId"
```

**After:**
```typescript
SELECT "dao_id" as "daoId" ... FILTER (WHERE "created_at" >= ...) GROUP BY "dao_id"
```

**Status:** ✅ Fixed and tested

---

## 🔒 Safety Features Verified

1. **Founder Protection** ⛔
   - Founders cannot leave own DAOs
   - Returns 403 Forbidden if attempted
   - Prevents accidental DAO orphaning

2. **Duplicate Prevention**
   - Cannot join same DAO twice
   - Returns 400 Bad Request if already member
   - Enforced at API level

3. **Existence Validation**
   - All operations validate DAO exists
   - 404 responses for non-existent DAOs

4. **Authentication**
   - All write operations require JWT
   - Dashboard stats endpoint is public
