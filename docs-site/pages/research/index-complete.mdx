2. Novel tiered governance model with constraints
3. Regional financial integration (M-Pesa, banks, fiat ramps)
4. Agent constraint framework for safe autonomy
5. Proven results (100+ members, 99.97% uptime, 0 security breaches)

**Technical Contributions**:
- Multi-agent coordination for DAO governance
- Constraint-based autonomous execution framework
- Regional payment integration architecture
- RBAC system with 9 permissions × 4 roles

**Practical Contributions**:
- 2.2x faster decisions than traditional DAOs

- 100% safety compliance
- 14+ month treasury runway

**Limitations & Future Work**:
- Current deployment: 127 members (future: 1000+)
- Agents currently rule-based (future: LLM-based)
- Single-region focus (expanding: multi-region federation)
- Manual agent tuning (future: auto-tuning via ML)
