[Learn about security →](/faq/security)

### What if members don't pay?

You set contribution rules when creating your DAO:
- Late payment grace periods
- Automatic membership suspension after X missed payments
- Reinstatement conditions

Everything is enforced automatically by smart contracts.

### Can I change DAO settings later?

Yes! Changes require a **governance proposal** that all members vote on:
1. Someone proposes the change
2. Members discuss and vote
3. If approved, changes take effect automatically

This ensures transparency and prevents unilateral decisions.
