# Create Your First DAO

Let's walk through creating your first DAO on MtaaDAO. It takes less than 2 minutes!

## Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

First, you'll need a Web3 wallet. We support:

- **MiniPay** (Recommended for mobile users)
- **Valora** (Built for Celo)
- **MetaMask** (Most popular)

```jsx
import { WalletSetup } from '@/components/WalletSetup'

<WalletSetup />
```

## Step 2: Choose Your DAO Type

Select the type that matches your needs:

import { DAOTypeComparison } from '../../components/DAOTypeComparison'

<DAOTypeComparison />

## Step 3: Configure Your DAO

Fill in the basic details:

- **DAO Name**: e.g., "Nairobi Youth Wedding Fund"
- **Purpose**: Brief description (1-2 sentences)
- **Target Amount**: How much you're raising (optional)
- **Duration**: For Short-Term DAOs (30 days default)
- **Contribution Amount**: Minimum per member

## Step 4: Set Governance Rules

Decide how decisions will be made:

- **Voting Period**: How long votes stay open (default: 3 days)
- **Quorum**: Minimum % of members needed to pass (default: 51%)
- **Proposal Threshold**: Minimum contribution to create proposals

## Step 5: Invite Members

Add members by:

- **Wallet Address**: If they already have a wallet
- **Phone Number**: We'll send them an invite
- **Username**: If they're already on MtaaDAO

## Step 6: Fund Your DAO

Make your first deposit to activate the DAO:

```bash
Minimum Initial Deposit:
- Short-Term: 1,000 KES
- Collective: 5,000 KES  
- MetaDAO: 10,000 KES
```

## Step 7: Launch! 🚀

Review everything and click **"Create DAO"**. Your community treasury is now live and transparent!
