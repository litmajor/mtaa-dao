# DAO Lifecycle Management

Understanding how DAOs evolve on MtaaDAO — from creation to completion or continuation.

## Short-Term DAO Lifecycle

### Phase 1: Creation (Day 0)
- Pay ₭500 setup fee
- Configure DAO (name, goal, members)
- Set 30-day duration
- Launch and invite members

### Phase 2: Active Fundraising (Days 1-25)
- Members contribute to treasury
- Track progress toward goal
- Transparent fund visibility
- Community engagement

### Phase 3: Approaching Expiry (Days 25-30)

**System Notification** (5 days before expiry):
> "Your DAO expires in 5 days. Choose your next step:"

#### Option 1: Extend (1st Time)
- **Cost**: ₭500
- **Duration Added**: 15 days
- **New Expiry**: Day 45

#### Option 2: Upgrade to Collective
- **Cost**: ₭1,500/month
- **Benefit**: Unlimited duration + full features
- **Transition**: Seamless, keeps all history

#### Option 3: Close & Archive
- **Process**: Disburse or return funds
- **Result**: DAO archived (publicly viewable)
- **Cost**: Free

### Phase 4: After 1st Extension (Day 45)

**Final Decision Notification**:
> "This is your final extension option:"

#### Option 1: Extend (2nd & Final Time)

## Extension Cost Analysis

| Timeline | Short-Term Cost | Collective Cost | Savings |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|---------|
| 30 days | ₭500 | ₭1,500 | ₭1,000 |
| 45 days | ₭1,000 | ₭1,500 | ₭500 |

*Forced upgrade after 2 extensions

## Archive & Transparency

### Archived DAOs Remain Viewable

All closed DAOs are preserved in the public registry:

✅ **Transaction History**: Every deposit, withdrawal, proposal  
✅ **Member List**: Who participated  
✅ **Final Report**: Goal achievement status  
✅ **Proof of Transparency**: Public accountability

### Why Archive Publicly?

- **Trust Building**: Shows platform transparency
- **Learning**: Future DAOs learn from past examples
- **Accountability**: Members can verify fund usage
- **Reputation**: Successful DAOs build creator credibility

## Lifecycle Notifications

MtaaDAO sends automated reminders at key milestones:

| Event | Timing | Actions Available |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Expiry Warning | 5 days before | Extend, Upgrade, Close |
| Final Extension | Day 45 | Last Extend, Upgrade, Close |
| Forced Decision | Day 52 | Upgrade or Close (auto) |
| Monthly Renewal | 3 days before | Review treasury balance |
| Low Treasury | When < 2 months fees | Top up warning |

## Best Practices

### For Short-Term DAOs
1. **Set Realistic Goals**: Achievable in 30 days
2. **Monitor Progress**: Check daily toward expiry
3. **Plan Ahead**: Decide extension/upgrade by Day 20
4. **Clear Communication**: Update members on timeline

### For Collective DAOs
1. **Maintain Treasury**: Keep 3+ months of fees in reserve
2. **Regular Activity**: Monthly proposals keep DAO alive
3. **Member Engagement**: Active participation = value
4. **Financial Planning**: Budget for long-term sustainability
