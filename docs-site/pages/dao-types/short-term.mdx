# Short-Term DAOs

Short-Term DAOs are perfect for time-limited causes like weddings, funerals, emergencies, or one-off community projects.

## Overview

- **Setup Fee**: ₭500 (one-time)
- **Initial Duration**: 30 days
- **Best For**: Events, emergencies, fundraisers

## Features

✅ Simple setup (goal, duration, members, treasury)  
✅ Shared wallet (multi-sig or smart contract)  
✅ Transparent fund tracking & contributor list  
✅ Expiry countdown and auto-lock on completion  
✅ Strategic extension options

## Extension Policy: Strategic Hybrid Model

MtaaDAO uses a **Strategic Hybrid** approach that encourages timely completion while offering flexibility:

### Extension Rules

1. **First Extension** (₭500)
   - Duration: 15 days (half of original)
   - Cost: ₭500
   - When: Available 5 days before expiry

2. **Second Extension** (₭500)
   - Duration: 7 days (half of first extension)
   - Cost: ₭500
   - Final extension allowed

3. **After Two Extensions**
   - Automatic upgrade to Collective DAO (₭1,500/month)
   - OR close and archive DAO

### Why This Works

✅ **Keeps Urgency**: Diminishing returns on extensions encourage completion  
✅ **Fair Revenue**: Platform earns proportionally to DAO longevity  
✅ **Natural Evolution**: Drives conversion to long-term plans  
✅ **Clean Platform**: No ghost DAOs lingering indefinitely

## Example: Wedding Fundraiser

**Initial Setup**: ₭500 for 30 days  
**Goal**: Raise 50,000 KES  

**Day 25**: Goal not met, need more time  
→ **1st Extension**: +15 days for ₭500  

**Day 40**: Almost there!  
→ **2nd Extension**: +7 days for ₭500  

**Day 47**: Goal achieved or must upgrade to Collective DAO

**Total Investment**: ₭1,500 for 47 days  
**Alternative**: Could have started with Collective DAO at ₭1,500/month

## When to Choose Short-Term DAO

✅ **Clear End Date**: Wedding, funeral, event  
✅ **Specific Goal**: Known fundraising target  
✅ **Temporary Team**: Group forms for this purpose only  
✅ **Budget Conscious**: ₭500 upfront vs ₭1,500/month

## When to Upgrade to Collective

If you find yourself needing extensions, consider upgrading:

- **Ongoing Needs**: Project continues beyond initial scope
- **Regular Activity**: Monthly meetings, recurring contributions
- **Full Features**: Need proposals, voting, advanced reporting
- **Unlimited Duration**: No expiry pressure
