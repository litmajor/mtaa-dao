# MetaDAOs: Networks of DAOs

## Umoja ni Nguvu (Unity is Strength)

A **MetaDAO** is a network of multiple DAOs working together for collective power. Think of it as a "DAO of DAOs"—a federation where independent communities coordinate, pool resources, and amplify their impact.

---

## What is a MetaDAO?

Imagine 20 farmer cooperatives across Kenya. Individually, each has limited bargaining power. But together as a MetaDAO, they can:
- Negotiate bulk seed prices
- Share expensive equipment
- Access larger financing
- Export collectively
- Lobby for policy changes

**MetaDAOs** enable this coordination while preserving each DAO's independence.

---

## Real-World Analogy

Think of MetaDAOs like **Sacco networks** or **cooperative unions**:

| Traditional Model | MetaDAO Model |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Individual Saccos | Member DAOs |
| Sacco Societies Regulatory Authority | Smart Contract Rules |
| Board of Directors | Coordinating Council |
| Shared Resources | Pooled Treasury |
| Member Saccos pay dues | Member DAOs contribute % |

## MetaDAO Structure

```
                    🌍 MetaDAO
                    (Coordinating Layer)
                         |
          ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐
          |              |              |
       DAO 1          DAO 2          DAO 3
    (Nairobi)      (Mombasa)      (Kisumu)
       |              |              |
    100 members    75 members    120 members
```

### Governance Levels

1. **DAO Level (Local)**
   - Each DAO manages its own affairs
   - Independent treasury
   - Local voting on local issues

2. **MetaDAO Level (Network)**
   - Cross-DAO proposals
   - Shared treasury for collective projects
   - Network-wide voting (weighted by DAO size)

---

## How MetaDAOs Work

### Joining a MetaDAO

**Requirements:**
1. Your DAO must be **Collective tier** or higher
2. At least 50 active members
3. 6+ months operational history
4. Good financial health (no defaults)
5. Approval by MetaDAO members (70% vote)

**Process:**
```
1. Apply to join MetaDAO
2. Pay joining fee (₭5,000-₭50,000 depending on MetaDAO)
3. Current member DAOs vote on your application
4. If approved, contribute to shared treasury
5. Gain voting power based on member count
```

### Voting Power

MetaDAOs use **quadratic voting** to balance small and large DAOs:

```
Voting Power = √(DAO Member Count)

Examples:
- 100-member DAO = 10 votes (√100)
- 400-member DAO = 20 votes (√400)
- 2,500-member DAO = 50 votes (√2,500)
```

This prevents large DAOs from dominating while rewarding scale.

### Contribution Model

Member DAOs contribute to the MetaDAO treasury:

**Option 1: Percentage of Transactions**
```
Every transaction in your DAO contributes:
- 0.5% to MetaDAO treasury
- Example: ₭100,000 transaction → ₭500 to MetaDAO
```

**Option 2: Fixed Monthly Dues**
```
Based on your DAO size:
- Small (50-200 members): ₭2,500/month
- Medium (201-500): ₭5,000/month
- Large (500+): ₭10,000/month
```

**Option 3: Hybrid**
```
₭1,000/month base + 0.2% of transactions
```

## MetaDAO Treasury Management

### Shared Treasury Powers

MetaDAOs can:
- Pool funds for bulk purchasing
- Invest in shared infrastructure
- Fund cross-DAO projects
- Emergency loans to member DAOs
- Collective bargaining deposits

### Multi-DAO Proposals

Creating a MetaDAO proposal:

```typescript
// Example: Bulk Fertilizer Purchase
{
  title: "Bulk Purchase 50 Tons of Fertilizer",
  proposer: "Siaya DAO",
  type: "bulk_purchase",
  budget: "₭2,500,000",
  beneficiaries: ["Siaya DAO", "Kisumu DAO", "Homa Bay DAO"],
  allocation: {
    "Siaya DAO": "20 tons (₭1M)",
    "Kisumu DAO": "20 tons (₭1M)",
    "Homa Bay DAO": "10 tons (₭500K)"
  },
  quorum: 70,  // % of MetaDAO voting power needed
  votingPeriod: 168  // 7 days for cross-DAO coordination
}
```

### Execution

Once approved:
1. Funds automatically transferred from MetaDAO treasury
2. Purchase contract executed
3. Distribution tracked on blockchain
4. Each DAO receives its allocation
5. Savings distributed back to MetaDAO treasury

## Case Study: Lake Region Agri-MetaDAO

### Background

Five farmer cooperatives in Western Kenya struggled with:
- High input costs (buying small quantities)
- Low negotiating power with processors
- Limited access to financing
- Inconsistent market access

### Solution: Formed MetaDAO

**Members:**
1. Kisumu Maize Farmers (120 members)
2. Homa Bay Sorghum Growers (85 members)
3. Siaya Mixed Farmers (200 members)
4. Migori Coffee Cooperative (60 members)
5. Kisii Tea Farmers (150 members)

**Total:** 615 farmers across 5 counties

### Achievements (Year 1)

**Bulk Purchasing:**
```
Savings on inputs:
- Fertilizer: 22% discount (₭3.2M saved)
- Seeds: 18% discount (₭980K saved)
- Equipment rental: 30% cheaper (₭1.5M saved)

Total Year 1 Savings: ₭5.68M
```

**Market Access:**
```
- Negotiated long-term contract with regional processor
- 15% price premium over individual sales
- Guaranteed off-take for 80% of produce
```

**Shared Infrastructure:**
```
- 2 cold storage facilities (shared cost)
- 1 grain drying facility
- 3 tractors (time-share model)
```

**Financial Services:**
```
- Established ₭10M emergency fund
- 12 member loans issued (avg ₭400K)
- 100% repayment rate
```

### Member Quote

> **"Before the MetaDAO, I sold my maize at ₭2,800 per bag. Now we get ₭3,500 because we negotiate together. Plus, I can rent a tractor for ₭800/day instead of ₭1,500. The MetaDAO has transformed our farming business."**

## Creating Your Own MetaDAO

### When to Create a MetaDAO

Consider forming a MetaDAO when:
- You have 3+ related DAOs ready to coordinate
- Combined membership exceeds 200 people
- Clear collective benefit from coordination
- Shared goals and values
- Geographic or sectoral synergy

### Setup Process

#### 1. Founding DAOs Align

```
Minimum 3 founding DAOs:
- Each must be Collective tier
- Combined 200+ members
- 6+ months operational
- Good governance record
```

#### 2. Define MetaDAO Parameters

```typescript
{
  name: "East Africa Creative MetaDAO",
  type: "sectoral",
  governanceModel: "quadratic_voting",
  contributionModel: "0.5% transaction fee",
  quorumRequirement: 70,
  votingPeriod: 168,  // 7 days for cross-DAO proposals
  executionDelay: 48,
  treasuryMultisig: "5-of-8",  // Requires 5 DAO representatives
  joiningFee: "₭25,000",
  monthlyDues: "Based on DAO size"
}
```

#### 3. Set Up Governance Council

```
Coordinating Council Structure:
- 1 representative per member DAO
- Rotating chairperson (6-month terms)
- Monthly coordination meetings
- Quarterly general assemblies
```

#### 4. Launch MetaDAO Treasury

```
Initial treasury capitalization:
- Each founding DAO contributes ₭50,000-₭200,000
- Establishes minimum operating capital
- Enables first collective projects
```

#### 5. Invite Additional DAOs

```
Growth strategy:
- Define ideal member profile
- Set application criteria
- Create onboarding process
- Establish vetting standards
```

- Cross-chain treasury transfers
- Multi-chain proposal execution
```

### Delegation Cascades

```
Member → DAO → MetaDAO voting

Individual members can delegate to:
1. Their DAO representative
2. MetaDAO coordinator
3. Specific issue experts
```

### Reputation & Trust Scoring

MetaDAOs track:
- Proposal quality scores
- Voting participation rates
- Financial health metrics
- Contribution consistency
- Cross-DAO collaboration scores

High scores unlock:
- Preferential loan terms
- Bulk purchasing access
- Speaking opportunities
- Network leadership roles

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can a DAO join multiple MetaDAOs?

Yes! DAOs can be members of multiple MetaDAOs. Example:
- Kisumu Farmers DAO → Lake Region AgriMetaDAO
- Same DAO → National Food Security MetaDAO
- Same DAO → Climate Action MetaDAO

Each membership has separate dues and voting rights.

### What if DAOs disagree on MetaDAO proposals?

Member DAOs vote independently. A proposal passes at the MetaDAO level based on collective voting power, even if individual DAOs voted against it.

However, **opt-out clauses** allow DAOs to exclude themselves from specific proposals.

### Can a DAO leave a MetaDAO?

Yes. Process:
1. Submit exit proposal to MetaDAO
2. 30-day notice period
3. Settle any outstanding obligations
4. Receive pro-rata share of contributed capital
5. Lose access to MetaDAO resources

### How are disputes resolved?

MetaDAOs have built-in arbitration:
1. Internal mediation (Coordinating Council)
2. Member vote on dispute
3. External arbitration (if needed)
4. Smart contract-enforced resolution
