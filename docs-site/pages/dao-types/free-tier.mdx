# Free Tier DAOs

## Perfect for Testing & Small Groups

The Free Tier is your risk-free way to explore MtaaDAO. It's designed for small communities (5-10 people) who want to test the platform or manage simple, low-volume operations.

✅ **Great for:**
- Testing the platform before upgrading
- Small friend groups pooling for a one-time event

- Pilot projects before scaling up

❌ **Not ideal for:**

## Limitations to Know

### 1. Member Limit (10 People Max)

When you hit 10 members, you'll need to upgrade or your DAO will be locked:

```
⚠️ Member Limit Reached
Your DAO has reached 10 members (Free Tier limit).

Options:
1. Upgrade to Short-Term DAO (₭500)
2. Upgrade to Collective DAO (₭1,500/month)
3. Remove inactive members
```

**What happens:** New join requests are automatically rejected.

### 2. Treasury Cap (₭50,000)

If your treasury exceeds ₭50,000, deposits are paused:

```
⚠️ Treasury Limit Reached
Your treasury has reached ₭50,105 (limit: ₭50,000).

No new deposits allowed until you:
1. Disburse funds below limit
2. Upgrade to paid tier (no limit)
```

### 3. Transaction Limit (20/month)

This includes:
- Member contributions
- Proposal executions
- Fund disbursements
- Internal transfers

**What happens:** After 20 transactions, all activity pauses until next month or you upgrade.

## Perfect Use Cases

### 1. Testing Before Launching

**Scenario:** You want to start a funeral fund but aren't sure how MtaaDAO works.

**Solution:** Create a Free Tier DAO with 5-8 trusted friends. Test contributions, proposals, voting for 1-2 months. Once comfortable, upgrade to Collective.

### 2. One-Time Event Fundraiser

**Scenario:** Organizing a friend's surprise birthday party. Need ₭30,000 from 8 people.

**Solution:** Free Tier DAO where everyone contributes ₭3,750. Once funds collected and event paid for, dissolve the DAO.

### 3. Student Group Project

**Scenario:** University students pooling ₭15,000 for a research trip.

**Solution:** Free Tier works perfect for short-term student needs with limited funds.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I stay on Free Tier forever?

Yes! As long as you:
- Stay under 10 members
- Keep treasury under ₭50,000
- Make fewer than 20 transactions/month

There's no time limit.

### What if I accidentally exceed limits?

Your DAO goes into "soft pause":
- Existing members can still vote on proposals
- No new contributions accepted
- No new members can join

**Fix it by:** Upgrading or reducing activity to fit limits.

### Can I downgrade from paid to Free?

Yes, but:
1. You must first reduce members to 10 or less
2. Treasury must be below ₭50,000
3. Request downgrade via support
4. Takes 48 hours to process

### Do free tier DAOs expire?

No! They're permanent as long as they stay within limits.

### Is free tier less secure?

**No.** Security is identical across all tiers:
- Multi-signature smart contracts
- Blockchain verification
- Encrypted data
- Same audit standards
