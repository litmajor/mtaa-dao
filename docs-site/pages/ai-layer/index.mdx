# AI Layer Overview

MtaaDAO's AI layer is a three-tier consciousness model that powers intelligent decision-making, automation, and natural language interaction across the platform.

## The Three Layers

### 🧠 NURU - The Mind (Cognitive Core)

NURU provides reasoning, analytical intelligence, and contextual awareness. It acts as the invisible brain behind the assistant.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Natural language understanding and intent recognition
- Financial, governance, and community analytics
- Risk assessment and ethical compliance
- Predictive modeling and forecasting

### 🏘️ KWETU - The Body (Community & Economic Layer)

KWETU manages DAO operations, treasury functions, and community interactions. It's the operational layer that executes decisions.

**Key Functions:**
- Wallet and vault management
- Proposal execution and voting
- Treasury operations and payments
- Community engagement tracking

### 💬 MORIO - The Spirit (Conversational Interface)

MORIO is the conversational AI persona that users interact with. It provides a natural, accessible interface to all DAO functions.

**Features:**
- Multi-language support (English, Swahili)
- Context-aware conversations
- Guided workflows and onboarding
- Real-time assistance

## System Flow

```
User Query
    ↓
MORIO (Interface) - Receives and understands user intent
    ↓
NURU (Reasoning) - Analyzes context and generates recommendations
    ↓
KWETU (Execution) - Performs DAO operations
    ↓
MORIO (Response) - Delivers results to user
```

## Use Cases

### Treasury Prediction
```typescript
// User asks: "What will our treasury balance be in 30 days?"
const prediction = await nuru.predictTreasuryGrowth(daoId);
// Returns: predicted balance with confidence score
```

### Proposal Risk Assessment
```typescript
// User submits a high-value proposal
const risk = await nuru.assessRisk(proposalId, daoId);
// Returns: risk factors and recommendations
```

### Natural Language Queries
```typescript
// User asks: "Pesa zetu ni ngapi?" (Swahili for "How much money do we have?")
const response = await morio.handleMessage({
  userId,
  daoId,
  content: "Pesa zetu ni ngapi?"
});
// Returns: Treasury balance in user's language
```

## Getting Started

1. **For Users**: Simply chat with Morio using the floating chat button
2. **For Developers**: See the [Integration Guide](/ai-layer/integration)
3. **For Admins**: Configure AI features in DAO settings

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Treasury Prediction Accuracy | 65% | 80% |
| Task Verification Accuracy | 85% | 90% |
| Response Time | <200ms | <100ms |
| Intent Recognition | 90% | 95% |
