# Bill Splitting

Easily divide expenses among multiple people with automated payment collection and settlement.

---

## Overview

Bill splitting allows you to:

- **Divide costs** among group members
- **Track who paid** and who owes
- **Automate reminders** for pending payments
- **Settle balances** with one-click payments

Perfect for:
- Shared DAO expenses
- Group purchases
- Event costs
- Shared subscriptions

---

## How It Works

### 1. **Create a Split Bill**

```typescript
const bill = {
  title: "Team Lunch",
  totalAmount: "100",
  currency: "cUSD",
  participants: [
    "0x1234...", // Alice
    "0x5678...", // Bob
    "+254712345678", // Charlie (phone number)
    "0x9abc..."  // David
  ],
  splitMethod: "equal" // or "custom", "percentage"
};
```

### 2. **Split Methods**

#### **Equal Split**

Divide equally among all participants:

```
Total: 100 cUSD
Participants: 4
Each pays: 25 cUSD
```

#### **Custom Amounts**

Specify exact amounts for each person:

```typescript
const customSplit = {
  "Alice": "40",
  "Bob": "30",
  "Charlie": "20",
  "David": "10"
};
```

#### **Percentage Split**

Distribute by percentage:

```typescript
const percentageSplit = {
  "Alice": "40%",
  "Bob": "30%",
  "Charlie": "20%",
  "David": "10%"
};
```

#### **Share-Based Split**

Divide by shares (useful for unequal contributions):

```typescript
const sharesSplit = {
  "Alice": 2, // Gets 2/5 of the bill
  "Bob": 2,   // Gets 2/5 of the bill
  "Charlie": 1 // Gets 1/5 of the bill
};
```

## Creating a Bill Split

### From DAO Dashboard

1. Go to **Treasury** → **Expenses**
2. Click **"Split Bill"**
3. Enter bill details:
   - Description
   - Total amount
   - Currency (cUSD, cEUR, CELO, etc.)
4. Add participants:
   - Enter wallet addresses or phone numbers
   - Choose split method
   - Assign amounts/percentages
5. Review and create
6. Participants receive payment requests

### From Wallet

1. Navigate to **Wallet** → **Split Bills**
2. Click **"New Split"**
3. Upload receipt (optional)
4. Add participants and amounts
5. Send payment requests

---

## Payment Collection

### **Automatic Reminders**

System sends reminders to participants:
- **Immediate**: Upon bill creation
- **3 days**: If unpaid
- **7 days**: Final reminder

### **Payment Methods**

Participants can pay via:
- **Direct wallet transfer**
- **Phone number payment** (MiniPay)
- **QR code scan**
- **Payment link**

### **Partial Payments**

Allow participants to pay in installments:

```typescript
const bill = {
  // ...
  allowPartialPayments: true,
  minimumPayment: "10" // Minimum per payment
};
```

---

## Settlement & Tracking

### **Real-Time Balance**

View who has paid and who owes:

```
Total: 100 cUSD

✅ Alice: 25 cUSD (Paid)
✅ Bob: 25 cUSD (Paid)
⏳ Charlie: 25 cUSD (Pending)
❌ David: 25 cUSD (Overdue)
```

### **Auto-Settlement**

When all participants pay, funds are automatically:
- Collected into a temporary escrow
- Distributed to the original payer
- Transaction recorded on-chain

### **Dispute Resolution**

If someone disagrees with the split:
1. Open a dispute
2. Provide reasoning
3. Other participants vote
4. Majority decision prevails

---

## Advanced Features

### **Expense Categories**

Tag bills for easy tracking:

```typescript
const bill = {
  // ...
  category: "food", // food, transport, utilities, entertainment
  tags: ["team-building", "Q4-2025"]
};
```

### **Receipt Upload**

Attach receipts for transparency:

```typescript
const bill = {
  // ...
  receipt: {
    file: receiptImage,
    url: "ipfs://Qm..."
  }
};
```

### **Recurring Split Bills**

For regular shared expenses:

```typescript
const recurringBill = {
  title: "Monthly Office Rent",
  amount: "1000",
  participants: [...],
  frequency: "monthly",
  splitMethod: "equal"
};
```

### **Multi-Currency Support**

Split bills in different currencies:

```typescript
const multiCurrencyBill = {
  totalAmount: "100",
  baseCurrency: "cUSD",
  allowCurrencyChoice: true, // Participants can pay in preferred currency
  exchangeRate: "auto" // Uses oracle price feeds
};
```

---

## Group Expenses

### **Expense Pools**

Create shared expense pools for ongoing costs:

```typescript
const expensePool = {
  name: "Team Activities Fund",
  members: [...],
  monthlyContribution: "50",
  useCase: "Shared team expenses"
};
```

### **Balance Tracking**

See who has contributed more or less:

```
Alice: +150 cUSD (contributed more)
Bob: -50 cUSD (owes the group)
Charlie: 0 cUSD (balanced)
```

### **Settle Up**

One-click settlement of group balances:

```typescript
// Bob owes Alice 50 cUSD and Charlie 25 cUSD
// System calculates optimal payment path:
Bob → Alice: 50 cUSD
Bob → Charlie: 25 cUSD
```

---

## Smart Split Features

### **Tax Inclusion**

Automatically include tax and tips:

```typescript
const bill = {
  subtotal: "100",
  tax: "10", // 10%
  tip: "15", // 15%
  total: "125" // Auto-calculated
};
```

### **Itemized Splits**

Split by individual items:

```typescript
const itemizedBill = {
  items: [
    { name: "Pizza", cost: "20", participants: ["Alice", "Bob"] },
    { name: "Salad", cost: "15", participants: ["Alice", "Charlie"] },
    { name: "Drinks", cost: "10", participants: ["all"] }
  ]
};
```

### **Fairness Calculator**

System suggests fair splits based on:
- Previous contribution history
- Wallet balances
- Payment reliability
