## Vaults System

### What is a Vault?

A vault is a smart contract-based system for **managed investments** that generate yield through DeFi strategies.

    B --> C[Yield Strategies]
    C --> D[Moola Lending]
    C --> E[Ubeswap LP]

    D --> G[Yield Generated]
    E --> G
    F --> G
    G --> B
    B --> H[User Withdraws + Profit]
```

### Types of Vaults

#### 1. Personal Vaults (Individual)

**Purpose**: Personal savings with yield generation

**Features**:
- Individual ownership
- Professional management
- Automated yield strategies
- Performance tracking

**Example**:
```typescript
// Creating a personal vault
const personalVault = {
  type: "personal",
  userId: "user_123",
  initialDeposit: "1000 cUSD",
  strategy: "conservative", // 8-10% APY
  managementFee: "2%",
  performanceFee: "15%"
}
```

#### 2. Community Vaults (DAO Treasury)

**Purpose**: Shared DAO treasury with governance

**Features**:
- Multi-signature control
- Proposal-based withdrawals
- Community voting
- Transparent management

**Example**:
```typescript
// DAO community vault
const daoVault = {
  type: "community",
  daoId: "dao_456",
  totalMembers: 50,
  governance: "multi-sig",
  withdrawalApproval: "60% quorum required",
  strategy: "moderate" // 10-15% APY
}
```

#### 3. MaonoVault (Professional Managed)

**Purpose**: ERC4626 compliant vault with advanced strategies

**Features**:
- Share tokenization (ERC4626)
- NAV tracking
- Professional fund management
- Risk assessment
- Multi-asset support (planned)

**Smart Contract Architecture**:
```solidity
contract MaonoVault is ERC4626 {
  // Users deposit assets
  function deposit(uint256 assets, address receiver) 
    returns (uint256 shares);
  
  // Users receive shares representing ownership
  function balanceOf(address account) 
    returns (uint256 shares);
  
  // Manager updates NAV based on strategy performance
  function updateNAV(uint256 newNAV) 
    onlyManager;
  
  // Users redeem shares for assets + profit
  function redeem(uint256 shares, address receiver) 
    returns (uint256 assets);
}
```

## Key Differences Explained

### Ownership Model

**Wallet**:
```
You own → 100 cUSD directly
```

**Vault**:
```
You own → 100 vault shares
Shares represent → ~105 cUSD (after yield)
```

### Control & Access

| Aspect | Wallet | Vault |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Immediate Access** | ✅ Instant | ⏳ Withdrawal delay (24-48h for large amounts) |
| **Full Control** | ✅ Complete | 🔒 Manager executes strategies |
| **Decision Making** | ✅ Solo | 🗳️ Governance (for DAO vaults) |

### Risk & Returns

**Wallet**:
- **Risk**: Low (you control everything)
- **Returns**: 0% (no yield, just storage)
- **Best For**: Active spending, immediate liquidity

**Vault**:
- **Risk**: Medium (DeFi strategies have risk)
- **Returns**: 8-15% APY (depending on strategy)
- **Best For**: Savings, long-term growth

    participant U as User
    participant V as MaonoVault
    participant D as DeFi Strategies
    
    U->>W: Receive salary (1000 cUSD)
    W->>W: Keep 200 cUSD for expenses
    U->>V: Deposit 800 cUSD to vault
    V->>U: Issue 800 vault shares
    V->>D: Deploy 800 cUSD to strategies
    
    Note over D: 30 days pass...
    D->>V: Return 880 cUSD (10% yield)
    
    U->>V: Need emergency funds
    U->>V: Withdraw 200 shares
    V->>U: Transfer 220 cUSD to wallet
    Note over U: Gained 20 cUSD profit!
```

## Fee Comparison

### Personal Wallet Fees

| Transaction Type | Fee |
|------------------|-----|
| **Internal Transfer** | Free (DAO to DAO) |
| **External Send** | Gas fee (~$0.001) |
| **Receive** | Free |
| **Currency Swap** | 0.3% (planned) |

### Vault Fees

| Fee Type | Amount | Frequency |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Management Fee** | 2% | Annual |
| **Performance Fee** | 15% | On profits only |
| **Deposit** | Free | N/A |
| **Withdrawal** | Free | N/A |

**Example Vault Fee Calculation**:
```
Deposit: 1000 cUSD
After 1 year: 1100 cUSD (10% yield)

Management Fee: 1000 × 2% = 20 cUSD
Performance Fee: 100 × 15% = 15 cUSD
Total Fees: 35 cUSD

Your Net Profit: 100 - 35 = 65 cUSD
Net Return: 6.5% APY (after fees)
```

## Best Practices

### Diversification Strategy

Recommended Allocation:
├── Personal Wallet (20%): 2,000 cUSD
│   └── For daily expenses, emergencies
│
├── Low-Risk Vault (50%): 5,000 cUSD
│   └── Conservative DeFi strategies
│
└── Growth Vault (30%): 3,000 cUSD
    └── Higher yield, higher risk strategies
```

### Monthly Workflow

## FAQ
