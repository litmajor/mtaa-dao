# Funeral Fund DAO (Mchango wa Mazishi)

## Supporting Each Other in Times of Loss

In African communities, **we bury our own**. When someone passes, the community comes together—financially, emotionally, spiritually. A Funeral Fund DAO digitizes this sacred tradition while preserving its soul.

## Why Funeral Funds Need DAOs

### Traditional Challenges

❌ **Manual Collection:** WhatsApp messages, M-Pesa to organizer, Excel tracking  
❌ **Trust Issues:** "Where did all the money go?"  
❌ **Delays:** Waiting days for organizer to gather and send funds  
❌ **No Accountability:** Opaque processes, missing receipts  
❌ **Embezzlement Risk:** Single person controls all funds

### MtaaDAO Solution

✅ **Automated Collection:** Members contribute monthly, funds locked securely  
✅ **Transparent Ledger:** Every shilling tracked on blockchain  
✅ **Instant Release:** Approved proposals execute in minutes, not days  
✅ **Multi-Signature:** 3+ elders must approve withdrawals  
✅ **Zero Embezzlement:** Smart contracts can't be manipulated

## How It Works

### Setup (One-Time, 15 Minutes)

1. **Define Your Circle**
   ```
   Who's covered?
   - Core members and their immediate family
   - Extended family (optional)
   - In-laws (optional)
   
   Example: 50 members covering themselves + parents + spouse
   = ~200 people protected
   ```

2. **Set Contribution Amount**
   ```
   Typical monthly contributions:
   - Small groups (20-40 people): ₭200-₭500/month
   - Medium groups (41-100): ₭500-₭1,000/month
   - Large groups (100+): ₭1,000-₭2,000/month
   
   Factors to consider:
   - Expected frequency of deaths (actuarial)
   - Target payout amount
   - Member affordability
   ```

3. **Choose Payout Structure**
   ```
   Option A: Fixed Amount Per Death
   - Example: ₭30,000 regardless of circumstances
   - Pros: Simple, predictable
   - Cons: May not cover all funeral costs
   
   Option B: Tiered by Relationship
   - Member dies: ₭50,000
   - Parent dies: ₭30,000
   - Spouse dies: ₭40,000
   - Child dies: ₭25,000
   
   Option C: Percentage of Treasury
   - Each death: 15% of current treasury balance
   - Pros: Scales with fund size
   - Cons: Variable payouts
   ```

4. **Set Governance Rules**
   ```typescript
   {
     quorum: 20,  // 20% of members must vote
     votingPeriod: 24,  // 24 hours to approve claim
     executionDelay: 2,  // 2 hours after approval before payout
     multiSigRequired: 3,  // 3 elders must sign
     gracePeriod: 7,  // 7 days late before suspension
     reinstatementFee: 1000  // ₭1,000 to rejoin after suspension
   }
   ```

## Monthly Operations

### Contribution Flow

```
Day 1 of Month:
┌─────────────────┐
│ Auto-Reminder   │ → SMS/WhatsApp to all members
│ "Contribute     │
│  ₭500 today"    │
└─────────────────┘
         ↓
┌─────────────────┐
│ Members Pay via │
│ - M-Pesa       │
│ - Bank Transfer│
│ - Crypto Wallet│
└─────────────────┘
         ↓
┌─────────────────┐
│ Funds Locked in │ → Multi-sig smart contract
│ DAO Treasury    │
└─────────────────┘
         ↓
┌─────────────────┐
│ Receipt Issued  │ → Blockchain confirmation
│ Member Account  │    + SMS notification
│ Updated         │
└─────────────────┘
```

### Late Payment Handling

```
Day 5: Reminder sent
Day 10: Final warning
Day 15: Account suspended (no voting rights)
Day 30: Removed from coverage
```

To reinstate:
1. Pay all missed contributions
2. Pay reinstatement fee (₭1,000)
3. Wait 30 days grace period before coverage resumes

## Financial Management

### Treasury Building

```
Example: 50-member funeral fund
Monthly contribution: ₭500/member
Annual collection: ₭300,000

Year 1:
- Deaths: 2 (avg)
- Payouts: ₭60,000
- Operating costs: ₭15,000 (5%)
- Net treasury: ₭225,000

Year 2:
- Starting balance: ₭225,000
- New contributions: ₭300,000
- Deaths: 3
- Payouts: ₭90,000
- Operating costs: ₭15,000
- Net treasury: ₭420,000

Year 3:
- Treasury is now sustainable
- Can consider:
  - Reducing monthly contributions
  - Increasing payout amounts
  - Adding emergency medical coverage
```

### Investment Strategy

Once treasury reaches target size (6x annual payouts), invest excess:

```
Conservative Investment Mix:
- 60% Money Market Funds (cUSD savings vaults)
- 30% Government Bonds
- 10% DeFi yield farming (low-risk protocols)

Expected returns: 8-12% annually

Benefits:
- Treasury grows faster than inflation
- Can eventually reduce member contributions
- Builds long-term sustainability
```

## Membership Rules

### Who Can Join?

Typical criteria:
```
✅ Age 18-65 (actuarial sweet spot)
✅ Living in defined geographic area
✅ Recommended by 2 existing members
✅ Pass KYC verification
✅ Accept DAO constitution

❌ Age 65+ (higher risk, may require higher contribution)
❌ Pre-existing terminal illness (waiting period required)
❌ History of fraud in other DAOs
```

### Joining Process

```
1. Apply via app or member referral
2. Pay joining fee (₭1,000-₭2,000)
3. Members vote on application (simple majority)
4. If approved, pay first month contribution
5. 90-day waiting period before coverage begins
6. Full membership rights after waiting period
```

**Why 90-day waiting period?**
Prevents "emergency joining" right before a death. Common practice in insurance/funeral societies.

## Governance & Decision-Making

### Types of Proposals

```
Created when: Someone dies
Vote requirement: 20% quorum, simple majority
Voting period: 24 hours
Execution: Automatic upon approval
```

**2. Rule Changes**
```
Examples:
- Increase payout from ₭30K → ₭40K
- Change monthly contribution
- Modify coverage rules
- Add/remove covered relationships

Vote requirement: 50% quorum, 66% supermajority
Voting period: 7 days (allows proper discussion)
Execution: Automatic, but phased implementation
```

**3. Member Disputes**
```
When to use:

## Pricing & Costs

### Monthly Member Cost

```
₭500 contribution breakdown:
- ₭475 → DAO Treasury (95%)
- ₭12.50 → Platform fee (2.5%)
- ₭12.50 → Transaction costs (M-Pesa, etc.)
```

### DAO Operational Cost

```
Collective Tier DAO: ₭1,500/month

For 50-member DAO:
- ₭1,500 ÷ 50 members = ₭30/member/month
- Add to individual contribution:  ₭500 + ₭30 = ₭530 total

For 100-member DAO:
- ₭1,500 ÷ 100 = ₭15/member/month
- Total: ₭515/member/month

Economies of scale: Larger DAOs = lower per-member cost
```

---

## Risk Management

### What if Treasury Runs Dry?

**Prevention Mechanisms:**
```
1. AI Monitoring
   - Morio AI alerts when treasury < 3x payout amount
   - Suggests: emergency top-up, temporary contribution increase
   
2. Emergency Assessments
   - DAO can vote for special one-time contribution
   - Example: "All members contribute extra ₭500 this month"
   
3. Tiered Payouts
   - If treasury low, auto-reduce payout temporarily
   - Example: ₭30K → ₭20K until treasury recovers
   
4. Reserve Fund
   - 10% of contributions go to untouchable reserve
   - Only accessible via supermajority vote (80%)
```

### Member Default Protection

```
What if 20% of members stop paying?

Options encoded in smart contract:
1. Suspend non-payers (no coverage)
2. Temporarily increase active members' contribution
3. Reduce payout amounts proportionally
4. Close enrollment (wait for treasury to recover)
```
