## Success Principles

What makes successful DAOs? We've analyzed hundreds of communities:

### 1. Clear Purpose

```
❌ "General community DAO"
✅ "Eastlands Funeral Fund for 50 families"

Why it matters: Specific goals drive participation
```

### 2. Right-Sized Membership

```
Optimal DAO sizes by type:
- Funeral Funds: 30-100 members
- Chamas: 15-50 members
- Farmer Coops: 50-300 members
- Creative: 10-40 members

Why it matters: Too small = limited resources
Too large = coordination overhead
```

### 3. Fair Contribution Model

```
✅ Monthly contributions members can afford
✅ Flexible payment schedules
✅ Grace periods for late payments
✅ Transparent fee structure

❌ Unrealistic contribution amounts
❌ Rigid payment schedules
❌ Hidden fees
❌ No hardship provisions
```

### 4. Active Governance

```
Healthy DAOs have:
- 70%+ voting participation
- Monthly proposals
- Regular financial reviews
- Engaged discussion forums

Struggling DAOs show:
- <30% voting participation
- No proposals for months
- Inactive treasury
- Silent members
```

### 5. Trust & Transparency

```
Built through:
- Blockchain-verified transactions
- Real-time treasury visibility
- AI-assisted proposal analysis

- Audit trails for everything
```
