# Creating Proposals

Proposals are the primary mechanism for making decisions and allocating resources in MtaaDAO. Any member can create a proposal that the community votes on.

## Proposal Types

### 1. Treasury Proposals

Request funds from the DAO treasury for specific purposes.

```typescript
{
  type: 'treasury',
  title: 'Marketing Campaign Q1 2026',
  description: 'Allocate funds for social media and community events',
  amount: 10000,
  currency: 'cUSD',
  recipient: '0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb'
}
```

**Use Cases:**
- Event funding
- Marketing campaigns
- Equipment purchases
- Service payments
- Emergency expenses

### 2. Governance Proposals

Change DAO settings, rules, or structure.

```typescript
{
  type: 'governance',
  title: 'Reduce Quorum to 40%',
  description: 'Lower quorum requirement to improve proposal throughput',
  changes: {
    quorumPercentage: 40
  }
}
```

**Common Changes:**
- Quorum requirements
- Voting periods
- Member permissions
- Treasury limits
- Proposal thresholds

### 3. Membership Proposals

Add or remove members, change roles.

```typescript
{
  type: 'membership',
  title: 'Add Sarah as Treasurer',
  description: 'Sarah has financial experience and will manage treasury',
  action: 'add',
  userId: 'user-123',
  role: 'treasurer'
}
```

### 4. Poll Proposals

Gauge community sentiment without binding actions.

```typescript
{
  type: 'poll',
  title: 'Preferred Event Date',
  description: 'Which date works best for annual meetup?',
  options: [
    'January 15',
    'January 22',
    'February 5'
  ]
}
```

## Proposal Lifecycle

```
Draft → Active → Voting → Passed/Rejected → Executed/Archived
```

### 1. Draft
- Proposal created but not yet submitted
- Can be edited or deleted
- Not visible to other members

### 2. Active
- Submitted for community review
- Members can discuss and ask questions
- Cannot be modified

### 3. Voting
- Voting period begins
- Members cast votes
- Progress tracked in real-time

### 4. Passed/Rejected
- Voting period ends
- Outcome determined by votes and quorum
- **Passed**: Proposal approved by majority
- **Rejected**: Proposal did not meet requirements

### 5. Executed/Archived
- **Executed**: Approved actions completed
- **Archived**: Rejected proposals stored

## Proposal Requirements

### Minimum Requirements

| Requirement | Value | Purpose |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| Title Length | 10-100 chars | Clarity |
| Description | >100 chars | Justification |
| Voting Period | 3-30 days | Adequate time |
| Quorum | 20-60% | Community engagement |

### Treasury Proposals

Additional requirements:
- **Budget Limit**: Cannot exceed 30% of treasury
- **Justification**: Detailed breakdown of costs

### Good Proposal Example

```markdown
# Title: Q1 Marketing Campaign

## Description
This proposal requests 10,000 cUSD to fund our Q1 2026 marketing 
campaign focused on growing our member base and community engagement.

## Budget Breakdown
- Social media ads: 4,000 cUSD
- Community events: 3,000 cUSD
- Content creation: 2,000 cUSD
- Contingency: 1,000 cUSD

## Timeline
- January 1-15: Campaign planning
- January 16-March 31: Campaign execution
- April 1-15: Results analysis

## Success Metrics
- Increase members by 25% (from 200 to 250)
- Host 3 community events
- Achieve 10,000 social media impressions

## Expected Impact
Growing our community will increase treasury contributions, enhance 
governance participation, and strengthen our ecosystem.
```

### Poor Proposal Example

```markdown
# Title: Need money

## Description
We should get some money for stuff we need to do.

## Amount: 50,000 cUSD
```

**Issues:**
- ❌ Vague title and description
- ❌ No budget breakdown
- ❌ No timeline or milestones
- ❌ No success criteria
- ❌ Amount too high (likely >30% of treasury)

## AI-Powered Proposal Assistance

### Proposal Quality Scoring

Morio AI evaluates proposals before submission:

```typescript
const score = await morio.scoreProposal(proposalDraft);
```

**Scoring Criteria:**

```

### Risk Assessment

AI automatically assesses proposal risks:

```typescript
const risk = await nuru.assessRisk(proposalId, daoId);
```

**Risk Factors:**
- Budget compliance
- Historical success rate
- Community benefit
- Implementation feasibility

## Proposal Discussion

### Comments

Members can discuss proposals:

```typescript
await fetch(`/api/proposals/${proposalId}/comments`, {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    comment: 'Great idea! Have you considered...'
  })
});
```

### Questions & Answers

Proposers should actively engage:

```
Member: "How will you measure success?"
Proposer: "We'll track member growth weekly and report monthly"
```

## Proposal Analytics

Track proposal performance:

```typescript
const analytics = await fetch(`/api/proposals/${proposalId}/analytics`);
```

**Metrics:**
- View count
- Comment count
- Vote participation rate
- Sentiment analysis
- Similar past proposals

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do

- **Be Specific**: Clear goals and deliverables
- **Show Value**: Explain community benefit
- **Include Numbers**: Budget, timeline, metrics
- **Engage Early**: Discuss before formal submission
- **Respond Promptly**: Answer questions quickly
- **Be Realistic**: Achievable goals and budgets

### ❌ Don't

- **Be Vague**: Unclear or ambiguous requests
- **Rush**: Submit without community feedback
- **Overreach**: Unrealistic budgets or timelines
- **Ignore Questions**: Fail to engage with community
- **Duplicate**: Submit similar existing proposals
- **Exceed Limits**: Request >30% of treasury

## Proposal Execution

### Automatic Execution

Treasury proposals execute automatically upon approval:

1. Voting period ends
2. Proposal passes (majority + quorum)
3. Smart contract transfers funds
4. Proposer and members notified

### Manual Execution

Some proposals require manual action:

- Governance changes by admin
- Membership role updates
- Policy implementations

## Proposal History

View all proposals:

```typescript
const proposals = await fetch('/api/proposals?daoId=dao-123&status=all');
```

**Filter Options:**
- Status: active, passed, rejected, executed
- Type: treasury, governance, membership, poll
- Date range
- Proposer
