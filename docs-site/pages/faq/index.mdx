## General Questions

### What is MtaaDAO?

MtaaDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) platform designed specifically for African communities. We combine blockchain technology, AI assistance, and mobile money integration to help communities pool resources, make decisions democratically, and manage funds transparently.

Think of it as a **digital chama** or **cooperative** where every transaction is verified, every vote counts, and every member has equal access to information.

### Do I need to understand blockchain or crypto?

**No!** MtaaDAO is designed for everyday people. You can:
- Join a DAO with just your phone number
- Contribute using M-Pesa or bank transfer
- Vote on proposals without knowing what a "smart contract" is
- Receive payouts directly to your M-Pesa

The blockchain runs in the background, ensuring security and transparency—but you don't need to understand it to use the platform.

### Which countries can use MtaaDAO?

Currently available in:
- 🇰🇪 Kenya (full support including M-Pesa)
- 🇹🇿 Tanzania (M-Pesa, Airtel Money, Tigo Pesa)
- 🇺🇬 Uganda (MTN, Airtel)
- 🇷🇼 Rwanda (MTN, Airtel)

**Coming soon:**
- 🇪🇹 Ethiopia
- 🇬🇭 Ghana
- 🇳🇬 Nigeria
- 🇿🇦 South Africa

**International users:** Can participate using crypto wallets (CELO, cUSD, USDC)

## Money & Security

### Is my money safe?

Yes. MtaaDAO uses multiple layers of security:

1. **Multi-signature wallets** - Requires 3+ authorized members to approve withdrawals
2. **Blockchain verification** - Every transaction is permanently recorded and verifiable
3. **Smart contracts** - Code executes automatically; humans can't manipulate it
4. **Regular audits** - Third-party security firms audit our contracts
5. **Insurance** (Collective tier+) - Treasury funds protected up to ₭5M

**What we DON'T do:**
- ❌ Never touch your funds directly
- ❌ Can't reverse or modify transactions
- ❌ No central control over treasuries
- ❌ No access to your private keys

### What happens if MtaaDAO shuts down?

Your funds are safe even if MtaaDAO disappears:

- Treasury funds are stored in **self-custodial smart contracts** on the blockchain
- Your DAO exists independently of our platform
- Members can access funds directly via blockchain
- We provide emergency recovery tools and documentation
- Funds can be migrated to other platforms

**Your DAO outlives our platform.** That's the power of decentralization.

### Can someone steal the DAO's money?

Extremely difficult. Here's why:

**Traditional chama:** One person (treasurer) controls all funds  
**MtaaDAO:** Requires 3+ member signatures to move funds

**Attack scenarios:**

| Attack | Traditional | MtaaDAO |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Treasurer steals | ✅ Easy | ❌ Impossible |
| Hacked bank account | ✅ Possible | ❌ Multi-sig protection |
| Fake invoices | ✅ Common | ❌ Transparent, members vote |
| Insider collusion | ✅ Hard to detect | ❌ Blockchain audit trail |

**Only way to "steal":**
- Compromise 3+ member accounts simultaneously
- AND convince them to approve fraudulent transactions
- AND avoid detection by other members watching the blockchain

**Verdict:** More secure than traditional group banking.

## Joining & Membership

### How do I join a DAO?

Two ways:

**1. Invited by a member:**
```
1. Receive invite link/code via WhatsApp, SMS, etc.
2. Click link or enter code on mtaadao.com
3. Create account (30 seconds)
4. Make first contribution
5. You're in!
```

**2. Discover public DAOs:**
```
1. Browse DAO Directory (app.mtaadao.com/explore)
2. Find DAOs accepting new members

```

### Can I be in multiple DAOs?

Yes! Many users are members of:
- Funeral fund (family/community)
- Chama (investment group)

- Creative collective (passion project)

**No limit** on the number of DAOs you can join.

### What if I want to leave a DAO?

You can leave anytime:

```
1. Go to DAO Settings → Leave DAO
2. Receive pro-rata share of treasury (if applicable)
3. Lose voting rights immediately
4. Funds sent to your wallet within 48 hours
```

**Important:**

## Voting & Governance

### How does voting work?

**Basic process:**
```
1. Proposal created (by any member)
2. Discussion period (24-72 hours)
3. Voting period (24-168 hours)
4. Results announced (quorum check)
5. If passed, auto-execution
```

**Your vote weight** depends on DAO configuration:
- One person = one vote (default)
- Weighted by contribution amount
- Weighted by membership duration
- Hybrid models

[Learn more about voting →](/governance/voting)

### What if I disagree with a decision?

You have options:

1. **Vote "No"** - Express your opposition
2. **Propose alternative** - Create counter-proposal
3. **Request arbitration** - If decision violates rules
4. **Leave DAO** - Ultimate veto with your feet

**Minority rights protected:**
- Can't change fundamental rules without 80%+ approval
- Financial decisions require quorum (usually 20-30%)
- Appeals process for disputes

### Can I delegate my vote?

Yes! Collective DAOs support vote delegation:

```
Delegate to:
- Trusted member (expertise-based)
- Elder/admin (convenience)
- Sector expert (complex proposals)

You can:
- Revoke delegation anytime
- Override on specific votes
- Cascade delegations
```

## Technical Questions

### What blockchain does MtaaDAO use?

**Primary:** Celo (optimized for mobile, low fees)  
**Also supports:**
- Polygon (for compatibility)

**Why Celo?**
- ✅ Mobile-first design
- ✅ Ultra-low fees (₭5-₭15 per transaction)
- ✅ Stable coins (cUSD, cKES)
- ✅ Fast confirmations (5 seconds)
- ✅ Carbon-negative (climate-positive)

### Do I need a crypto wallet?

**No, unless:**
- You want to use crypto directly
- Your DAO operates primarily in crypto
- You're outside supported mobile money countries

### What are gas fees?

"Gas" is the cost to process blockchain transactions.

**If using crypto wallet:** ₭5-₭30 per transaction (very cheap on Celo)

**Example:**
```
Send ₭10,000 via M-Pesa:
- M-Pesa charge: ~₭20
- Platform fee (2.5%): ₭250
- Gas fee: ₭0 (we cover it)
- Total cost: ₭270

Send ₭10,000 via Crypto:
- Gas fee: ₭10
- Platform fee (2.5%): ₭250
- Total cost: ₭260
```

## Troubleshooting

### I sent money but it's not showing

**Check:**
1. Transaction ID/reference correct?
2. Sent to right DAO paybill/account?
3. Confirmation SMS received from M-Pesa?

**Timeframes:**
- M-Pesa: 5-15 minutes
- Bank transfer: 1-24 hours
- Crypto: 5-30 seconds

**If delayed:**
- Check "Pending Transactions" in DAO treasury
- Contact DAO admin with proof of payment
- Email support@mtaadao.com with transaction ID

### I can't log in

**Try:**
1. Reset password (app.mtaadao.com/reset)

4. Use "Login with Google/Telegram" instead

### Proposal won't execute

**Common reasons:**
- ❌ Quorum not met (not enough votes)

- ❌ Insufficient treasury balance
- ❌ Technical error (contact support)

**Check:**
1. Did proposal pass? (Yes votes > No votes)
2. Was quorum reached? (X% of members voted)
3. Is voting period over?
4. Does treasury have enough funds?

### DAO is suspended

**Reasons:**
- Non-payment of platform fees (3+ days)
- Reported for fraud (under investigation)
- Voluntary pause by admins
- Technical maintenance

**Resolve:**
1. Check DAO admin messages
2. Pay outstanding fees
3. Contact support if unclear
4. Appeal if wrongly suspended
