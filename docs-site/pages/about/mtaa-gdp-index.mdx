# MTAA GDP Index
## Making Community Economics Visible

---

## What is the MTAA GDP Index?

The **MTAA GDP Index** tracks the real economic value created by MtaaDAO communities - money that's transparent, measurable, and attributable to collective action.

### Why It Matters

Traditional GDP misses community-level economic activity:
- ❌ Informal savings groups
- ❌ Community investments
- ❌ Mutual aid networks
- ❌ Collective purchasing

**MTAA GDP captures what matters**:
- ✅ Every shilling pooled
- ✅ Every investment made
- ✅ Every project funded
- ✅ Every life improved

## How We Calculate It

### Core Metrics

**1. Direct Economic Activity**
```
Base GDP = Total Treasury Value + Annual Throughput
```

**Components**:
- Total AUM (Assets Under Management)
- Transaction volume
- Contributions collected
- Disbursements made

**2. Economic Multiplier**
```
Multiplier Effect = Direct Value × Impact Factor
```

**Impact Factors**:
- **Consumption** (1.2x): Money spent locally
- **Investment** (1.5x): Productive capital deployed
- **Micro-business** (2.0x): Enterprises funded
- **Infrastructure** (3.0x): Community assets built

**3. Social Value Added**
```
Social GDP = Economic Value + Non-Monetary Impact
```

**Non-Monetary Metrics**:
- Jobs created
- Skills developed
- Networks strengthened
- Trust built

### Example Calculation

**Nairobi Women's Chama DAO**
- Members: 50 women
- Monthly contributions: KES 500,000
- Annual throughput: KES 6,000,000
- Treasury balance: KES 2,000,000

**Direct GDP**: KES 8,000,000

**Multiplier Analysis**:
- 40% consumption (local shops): 2.4M × 1.2 = 2.88M
- 30% investment (DeFi): 1.8M × 1.5 = 2.7M
- 20% micro-business: 1.2M × 2.0 = 2.4M
- 10% infrastructure: 0.6M × 3.0 = 1.8M

**Total Impact**: KES 9.78M ≈ **122% multiplier**

## Impact Categories

### Category A: High Multiplier (2.5x+)

**Productive Investment**
- Small business funding
- Equipment purchases

### Category B: Medium Multiplier (1.5-2.5x)

**Local Economic Activity**
- Bulk purchasing
- Service contracts
- Community events
- Market access

**Example**:
- KES 500K → Farmers' inputs
- 30% cost savings → KES 150K reinvested
- Total impact: KES 650K (1.3x multiplier)

### Category C: Base Multiplier (1.0-1.5x)

**Savings & Insurance**
- Emergency funds
- Health insurance
- Education savings
- Pension contributions

**Example**:

## Comparison to Traditional GDP

### Kenya National GDP (2024)
- Total: $113 billion
- Per capita: $2,200
- Growth: 5.4%

### MTAA GDP (Target 2025)
- Total: $50 million
- Per capita (DAO members): $500
- Growth: 150%+

**That's 0.04% of national GDP from <1% of population**

### Extrapolation Impact

If 10% of Kenyans used MtaaDAO:
- MTAA GDP: $5 billion
- National GDP impact: +4.4%
- Jobs created: 500,000+
- Economic inclusion: 5M+ people
