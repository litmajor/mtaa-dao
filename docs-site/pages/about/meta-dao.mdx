# Meta DAO & Regional Hubs
## Building Economic Power Through Coordination

---

## What is a Meta DAO?

A **Meta DAO** is a DAO of DAOs - a coordinating layer that enables multiple community DAOs to work together while maintaining their independence.

Think of it as:
- **United Nations** for community DAOs
- **Federal system** with local autonomy
- **Network effect** multiplier
- **Collective bargaining** power

---

## Why Meta DAOs Matter

### The Problem of Fragmentation

Individual DAOs are powerful, but isolated:
- Limited negotiating power
- Duplicate infrastructure
- No knowledge sharing
- Missed collaboration opportunities

### The Power of Coordination

Meta DAOs unlock:
- **Bulk purchasing** power
- **Shared infrastructure** costs
- **Cross-DAO** investments
- **Regional** influence
- **Knowledge** networks

## Meta DAO Governance

### Representation Model

Each member DAO gets:
- **Base votes**: 1 vote (democratic baseline)
- **Treasury votes**: Based on AUM (capped at 10x)
- **Reputation votes**: Based on impact (capped at 5x)

**Example**:
- Small chama (10 members, $1K): 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 votes
- Large cooperative (500 members, $100K): 1 + 10 + 5 = 16 votes

### Proposal Types

**Regional Projects**
- Infrastructure investments
- Shared services
- Cross-DAO initiatives

**Policy Decisions**
