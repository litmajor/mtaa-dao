## Govern Together, Grow Together

**MtaaDAO** is Afrika's first AI-powered decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) platform designed for African communities. We're combining **blockchain**, **artificial intelligence**, and **mobile money** to democratize finance and governance.

### Our Mission (Lengo Letu)

Every community deserves the power to **govern itself**, **pool resources**, and **make decisions together**—without intermediaries, without corruption, without barriers. Whether you're organizing a chama, coordinating a harambee, or building a regional network, MtaaDAO gives you the tools to do it transparently.

**From Mtaa, For Mtaa.** Built by the people, for the people.
