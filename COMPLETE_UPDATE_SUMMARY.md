# Complete Navigation, Profile & Settings Update

## Overview
This document summarizes all the fixes and enhancements made to resolve navigation flickering, connect real APIs, and add comprehensive settings features.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Navigation Flickering ✅
**Problem:** App was flickering during navigation due to routing library mismatch  
**Solution:** Updated all components to use `react-router-dom` consistently

#### Files Updated:
- **`client/src/pages/hooks/useAuth.ts`**
  - Replaced `import { useLocation } from "wouter"` with `import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom"`
  - Changed `setLocation()` to `navigate()` in login, logout, and register mutations
  - Removed all `wouter` dependencies

- **`client/src/components/navigation.tsx`** (previously updated)
  - Already using `react-router-dom`

### 2. Profile Page - Real API Integration ✅
**Problem:** Profile page was using hardcoded mock data  
**Solution:** Connected to real backend API with proper data fetching

#### Frontend Changes:
- **`client/src/pages/profile.tsx`**
  - Added `useQuery` to fetch profile data from `/api/profile`
  - Implemented loading states with spinner
  - Implemented error states with retry button
  - Connected to real user data from auth context
  - Updated Settings button to use `navigate('/settings')`
  - Updated Logout button to use `logout()` function
  - Voting token balance now comes from API
  - All contribution stats now from real data
  - Recent activity from actual contributions

#### Backend Changes:
- **`server/routes/profile.ts`**
  - Added `PUT /api/profile/update` endpoint for updating profile
  - Returns `votingTokenBalance` in profile data
  - Changed `profileImageUrl` to `profilePicture` in response for frontend compatibility
  - Calculates real contribution stats from database
  - Computes activity streaks from user activities
  - Returns recent contributions and vault data

### 3. Comprehensive Settings Page ✅
**Problem:** Settings page was missing key features like 2FA, sessions, privacy, data export  
**Solution:** Completely rewrote settings page with 7 organized tabs

#### New Settings Structure:

1. **Profile Tab**
   - Update first name, last name, email
   - Real-time validation
   - Connected to `/api/profile/update` endpoint

2. **Security Tab**
   - ✅ Change password with current password verification
   - ✅ Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) toggle (placeholder for full implementation)
   - ✅ Active sessions management
     - Shows all active sessions with device info
     - Location and last active timestamp
     - Revoke individual sessions
     - Current session highlighted

3. **Privacy Tab**
   - ✅ Profile visibility settings (Public, Members, Private)
   - ✅ Activity visibility settings
   - ✅ Data sharing preferences
   - ✅ Data export functionality (download JSON)

4. **Appearance Tab**
   - Theme selection (Light, Dark, System)
   - Visual preferences

5. **Notifications Tab**
   - Existing notification preferences component

6. **Accessibility Tab**
   - High contrast mode
   - Font size adjustment
   - Reduced motion
   - Screen reader announcements

7. **Account Tab**
   - ✅ **Disable Account** (soft delete, can be reactivated)
     - Confirmation required
     - Deletes all sessions
   - ✅ **Delete Account** (permanent deletion)
     - Password verification required
     - Double confirmation
     - Irreversible warning

#### Backend API Endpoints Added:

**Profile Routes (`server/routes/profile.ts`):**
- `GET /api/profile` - Fetch complete profile data
- `PUT /api/profile/update` - Update profile information

**Account Routes (`server/routes/account.ts`):**
- `PUT /api/account/password` - Change password
- `POST /api/account/disable` - Disable account (soft delete)
- `DELETE /api/account/delete` - Permanently delete account
- `GET /api/account/sessions` - Get all active sessions
- `DELETE /api/account/sessions/:id` - Revoke specific session
- `POST /api/account/export` - Export user data as JSON
- `POST /api/account/2fa/enable` - Enable 2FA (placeholder)
- `POST /api/account/2fa/disable` - Disable 2FA (placeholder)

  };
  contributionStats: {
    totalContributions: number;
    monthlyContributions: number;
    currentStreak: number;
  };
  contributions: ContributionData[];

  votingTokenBalance: number;
}
```

### Session Data Structure

  current: boolean;
}

## Files Changed

### Frontend
- `client/src/pages/hooks/useAuth.ts` - Fixed routing
- `client/src/pages/profile.tsx` - Added real API integration
- `client/src/pages/settings.tsx` - Complete rewrite with 7 tabs
- `client/src/components/navigation.tsx` - Already using react-router-dom

### Backend
- `server/routes/profile.ts` - Added update endpoint, voting tokens
