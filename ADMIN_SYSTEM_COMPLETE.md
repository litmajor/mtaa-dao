const requireSuperAdmin = requireRole('super_admin');
```

**All admin endpoints are protected:**
- Only `super_admin` role can access
- JWT token required in Authorization header

```typescript
const { user } = useAuth();
const isOwner = user?.roles === 'super_admin' || user?.roles === 'admin';
```

**Access Control:**
- Redirects non-admin users to "Access Denied" screen
- Only loads analytics if user is admin
- Role-based UI rendering
