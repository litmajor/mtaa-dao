# Authentication System Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Missing Authorization Header** ✅
**Problem**: After login, the access token was stored in `localStorage` but never sent with subsequent API requests to `/api/auth/user`.

**Solution**: Updated `useAuth` hook to include the Bearer token from localStorage in all API requests:
```typescript
const token = localStorage.getItem('accessToken');
const headers: HeadersInit = {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
};

if (token) {
  headers['Authorization'] = `Bearer ${token}`;
}
```

### 2. **Excessive Console Logging** ✅
**Problem**: `auth_register.ts` had 7+ console.log statements spamming the terminal with undefined values during registration.

**Solution**: Removed excessive logging statements from `verifyOtpHandler` while keeping essential error logging.

### 3. **Inconsistent Field Names** ✅
**Problem**: User data had inconsistent field names across different endpoints:
- `profilePicture` vs `profileImageUrl`
- `emailVerified` vs `isEmailVerified`  
- `roles` vs `role`

**Solution**: Standardized all API responses to use consistent field names:
- `isEmailVerified` (boolean)
- `isPhoneVerified` (boolean)
- `role` (string)
- `profilePicture` (string | null)

### 4. **Token Storage and Cleanup** ✅
**Problem**: Auth tokens weren't properly cleared on logout or failed authentication.

**Solution**: 
- Added proper token cleanup on logout
- Clear invalid tokens when 401 errors occur
- Invalidate query cache to force re-authentication

### 5. **User Interface Mismatch** ✅
**Problem**: TypeScript interface didn't match the actual API response structure.

**Solution**: Updated User interface to include:
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string | null;
  phone: string | null;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  role: string;
  walletAddress?: string | null;
  isEmailVerified: boolean;
  isPhoneVerified: boolean;
  profilePicture?: string | null;
}
```

## How to Test

1. **Start the server** (it should already be running with the updated code)
   
2. **Register a new user**:
   - Go to `/register`
   - Enter email and password
   - Verify OTP (check terminal for OTP code in development)
   - Should redirect to dashboard

3. **Login**:
   - Go to `/login`
   - Enter credentials
   - Should redirect to `/dashboard` with user data loaded
   - No "undefined" spam in terminal

4. **Dashboard Access**:
   - Should load user data correctly
   - No infinite loading or authentication loops
   - User profile should display properly

5. **Logout**:
   - Click logout
   - Should clear all auth data
   - Should redirect to `/login`

## Files Modified

### Client-side:
- `client/src/pages/hooks/useAuth.ts` - Added Authorization headers and proper token handling
- `client/src/components/Login.tsx` - Fixed redirect method

### Server-side:
- `server/api/auth_register.ts` - Removed excessive logging, standardized response format
- `server/api/auth_user.ts` - Standardized user data response
- `server/blockchain.ts` - Fixed RPC polling to prevent filter errors (previous fix)

### Environment:
- `.env` - Created with correct database and Redis configuration

## Expected Behavior

✅ **Before**: 
- Login would hang or show loading forever
- Terminal spammed with "undefined" logs
- Dashboard wouldn't load user data
- 401 errors on authenticated requests

✅ **After**:
- Login succeeds and redirects to dashboard immediately
- Clean terminal output (no spam)
- Dashboard loads with user data
- All authenticated API calls include proper headers
- Logout works correctly

## Notes

- The `.env` file has been created with development credentials
- PostgreSQL database `mtaadao` already exists and is accessible
- Redis is running and connected
- All blockchain services are running properly

If you still see issues, check:
1. Browser localStorage has the `accessToken` key after login
2. Network tab shows `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header on `/api/auth/user` requests
3. No console errors in browser DevTools
