## 🔄 How It Works

### Investment Flow
```
1. User deposits $100 cUSD
   ↓
2. System calculates shares based on current pool value
   → If first investor: 100 shares at $1.00/share
   → If pool exists: shares = (100 * totalSupply) / TVL
   ↓
3. Shares minted to user's wallet
   ↓
4. TVL and share supply updated
   ↓
5. Investment recorded in database
```

### Withdrawal Flow
```
1. User redeems 50 shares
   ↓
2. System calculates value: 50 * sharePrice
   → Example: 50 * $1.05 = $52.50
   ↓
3. Performance fee calculated: $52.50 * 2% = $1.05
   ↓
4. Net amount: $52.50 - $1.05 = $51.45
   ↓
5. Shares burned, TVL updated
   ↓
6. $51.45 sent to user's wallet
```

### Share Price Calculation
```typescript
sharePrice = totalValueLocked / totalSupply

Example:
- TVL: $10,000
- Total Shares: 9,500
- Share Price: $10,000 / 9,500 = $1.0526
```

## 💰 Tokenomics Impact

### Weekly Pool Growth (Projected)
Based on user adoption estimates:

**Conservative Scenario:**
- 50 active pools
- Average $500 TVL per pool
- **Total: $25,000 TVL**

**Moderate Scenario:**
- 200 active pools
- Average $2,000 TVL per pool
- **Total: $400,000 TVL**

**Optimistic Scenario:**
- 1,000 active pools
- Average $10,000 TVL per pool
- **Total: $10,000,000 TVL**

### Performance Fee Revenue
At 2% withdrawal fee:
- Conservative: $500/month → $6,000/year
- Moderate: $8,000/month → $96,000/year
- Optimistic: $200,000/month → $2,400,000/year

**Note:** Fees go to DAO treasury, funding platform development and MTAA token buybacks.
