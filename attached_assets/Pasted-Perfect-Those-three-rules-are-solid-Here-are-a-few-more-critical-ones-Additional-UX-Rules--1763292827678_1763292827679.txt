Perfect. Those three rules are solid. Here are a few more critical ones:

## Additional UX Rules:

**4. No empty states without action**
- Bad: "No proposals yet" 
- Good: "No decisions yet. [Create the first one]"
- Never show users an empty screen without telling them what to do next

**5. Money always shows in local currency first**
- Bad: "0.5 ETH"
- Good: "$1,247 (0.5 ETH)" or just "$1,247"
- Most people don't think in crypto units

**6. Errors must explain what to DO, not what went wrong**
- Bad: "Transaction failed: insufficient gas"
- Good: "Not enough money for fees. Add $2 more."
- Technical errors scare users away

**7. Every number needs context**
- Bad: "APY: 12.5%"
- Good: "Your $100 becomes $112.50 in one year"
- Show what it means for THEM, not abstract percentages

**8. One primary action per screen**
- Bad: [Deposit] [Withdraw] [Transfer] [Swap] [Stake]
- Good: [Add Money] ... (other actions in menu)
- Don't overwhelm with choices

**9. Celebrate wins, hide losses**
- Show: "You earned $23 this week! 🎉"
- Don't show: "Market crashed -15% today"
- Keep it positive; power users can dig for details

**10. Mobile thumb-friendly tap targets**
- All buttons minimum 48x48px
- Primary actions at bottom of screen (easy to reach)
- No tiny links or small text

**11. Progressive disclosure**
- Show basics first, "See more" for details
- Don't dump all information at once
- Let users discover features gradually

**12. Trust before commitment**
- Let them explore without creating account
- Show example groups/success stories first
- Ask for money/permissions LAST, not first

## Implementation Checklist:

**For EVERY screen you build, ask:**
- [ ] Can my mom understand this without my help?
- [ ] Is there exactly ONE obvious thing to do?
- [ ] Are technical terms replaced with plain language?
- [ ] If something is empty, is there a clear action?
- [ ] Are amounts in local currency (KES/USD)?
- [ ] Can I tap all buttons with my thumb easily?
- [ ] Does this screen make the user feel smart and safe?

**Do these rules + your 3 make sense? Should I add/remove anything?**
