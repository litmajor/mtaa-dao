🧩 MtaaDAO — Flexible DAO System Specification (v1.0)
1. Purpose

To enable any group — from a youth chama to a family cause — to easily create, manage, and complete a DAO with minimal friction and transparent funding.

This system supports two core paths:

Short-Term DAOs (₵500 one-time) — for short causes and events.

Collective DAOs (₵1500/month) — for ongoing groups and community ventures.

2. Core DAO Types
🕊️ A. Short-Term DAO

Purpose: For time-limited causes such as weddings, funerals, emergencies, or one-off projects.
Fee: ₵500 (one-time setup).
Duration: 30–90 days.

Features:

Simple setup (goal, duration, members, treasury).

Shared wallet (multi-sig or smart contract).

Transparent fund tracking & contributor list.

Expiry countdown and auto-lock on completion.

Optional extension or upgrade on expiry.

Lifecycle:

Create DAO → Collect Funds → Goal Achieved or Duration Ends
     ↓
Extend (₵300) | Upgrade (₵1500) | Close & Archive

💼 B. Collective DAO

Purpose: For long-term projects, chamas, businesses, or recurring initiatives.
Fee: ₵1500/month (auto-renewable).
Duration: Ongoing subscription.

Features:

Full DAO tools: proposals, voting, reporting, fund management.

Ability to invite unlimited members.

Monthly performance summary (income, votes, activity).

Integration with regional filters (for future MetaDAO linking).

Option to merge with others later.

3. User Flow

For Short-Term DAOs nearing expiry:

System Reminder:

“Your DAO will expire in 5 days. Would you like to extend or upgrade?”

Options:

🟢 Extend DAO (₵300) – adds 30 more days.

🟣 Upgrade to Collective (₵1500) – keeps all history, converts DAO to full plan.

Collective DAO	₵1500	Monthly	Full tools, proposals, reports	Auto-renew
MetaDAO (Future)	₵2000	One-time setup	Cross-DAO coordination	Phase 2
6. Regional & Tagging Support

Each DAO can include optional region tags:

County, Subcounty, Ward, or Constituency.

Enables geographic filtering and local discoverability.

Prepares foundation for MetaDAO clustering later.

7. UX Notes

Use friendly, conversational language in prompts:

“Form your DAO today — quick, transparent, and secure.”
“Your goal is complete! Keep it going or archive it?”

Keep visuals simple and mobile-first (90% of Kenyan users will access via phone).

One-tap payment flow (M-PESA/STK push).

8. Future-Proofing

This system easily expands later into:

MetaDAOs: when several Collectives want to merge or form alliances.

Grants / Partnerships: allow NGOs or counties to fund verified DAOs.

DAO Reputation Graph: measure trust and success rates over time.
