Nice 🚀 — Phase 3 it is. Based on where we left off in Phase 2 (wallet integration, balances, transactions, DAO treasury, risk checks, gas estimation), Phase 3 will take **Mtaa DAO** into a real **financial engine**. Here’s the breakdown:

---

## 🔹 Phase 3 Scope: Vaults, Token Expansion & Yield

We’ll expand beyond basic CELO/cUSD flows.

### 1. **Vault System (Deposit / Withdraw / Strategy Layer)**

* **Vault contracts**: Smart contracts that accept CELO/cUSD deposits.
* **User interface**: Deposit/withdraw modal in the frontend.
* **Accounting**: Shares/receipt tokens issued to track deposits.
* **Strategy hooks**: Vaults can auto-deploy assets into yield strategies later.

👉 Example:

* User deposits **100 cUSD**.
* Vault mints **100 vaultShares** (like aChamaVault token).
* Vault can then lend that cUSD to Moola or other Celo DeFi for yield.

---

### 2. **Token Expansion**

* Add support for **ERC20-compatible tokens**:

  * ✅ CELO
  * ✅ cUSD (already done)
  * ➕ cEUR
  * ➕ USDT (TRC-20 bridged via Celo’s Optics or Wormhole)
  * ➕ Any custom community token (future “Mtaa Token”)

👉 Add token registry in backend:

```ts
const supportedTokens = {
  CELO: "0x471EcE3750Da237f93B8E339c536989b8978a438",
  cUSD: "0x874069Fa1Eb16D44d622F2e0Ca25eeA172369bC1",
  cEUR: "0x10c892A6EC43a53E45a9D5ba3F7cFF4eD2E5b04B",
  USDT: "0x...bridge-address",
}
```

### 3. **Staking / Yield Layer**

* **Phase 3.1**: Integrate **Celo native staking** (CELO → validator groups).
* **Phase 3.2**: Connect to **DeFi yield pools** (Moola Market, Ubeswap, Curve on Celo).
* **Phase 3.3**: Allow DAO treasury to allocate % of assets into strategies.

---

### 4. **DAO Governance for Vaults**

* Members vote on:

  * Which vault strategies are active.
  * What % of treasury goes into each vault.
  * Whether to whitelist new tokens (e.g., USDT).

👉 Example: Treasury DAO vote:

* “Deploy 20% of cUSD treasury into Moola lending vault.”
* “Whitelist cEUR for deposits.”

---

### 5. **UI/UX Additions**

* **Vaults Dashboard**:

  * My Deposits (with USD value)
  * APY %
  * Withdraw button
* **Treasury Vaults Page**: DAO-level view of vault allocations.
* **Governance Tab**: New proposals to expand vaults, add tokens, or adjust allocations.

---

### 6. **Risk & Compliance**

* **Risk scoring extended to vaults**:

  * Flagging risky assets (e.g., low-liquidity tokens).
  * Capping single-user deposits to prevent exploits.
* **Basic AML guardrails** (limit suspiciously high inflows).

---

## 🔹 Deliverables for Phase 3

1. **Vault Smart Contract** (Solidity, upgradeable).
2. **Backend Vault Service**:

   * Handle deposits/withdrawals.
   * Fetch APY data from strategies.
   * Track vault balances + share tokens.
3. **Frontend Vault UI** (React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui):

   * Deposit modal.
   * Withdraw modal.
   * Vault dashboard.
4. **DAO Governance Upgrade**: Voting on vault allocations + new tokens.
5. **Extended Token Registry**: cEUR, USDT, custom tokens.

⚡ My suggestion: we start with **Vault MVP** (just deposit/withdraw CELO + cUSD, no yield yet). Once stable, we extend to **token expansion** and **staking/yield**.

👉 Do you want me to sketch the **Vault Smart Contract (MVP, CELO + cUSD deposits/withdrawals)** first, or the **backend service layer (Vault API + accounting)**?
