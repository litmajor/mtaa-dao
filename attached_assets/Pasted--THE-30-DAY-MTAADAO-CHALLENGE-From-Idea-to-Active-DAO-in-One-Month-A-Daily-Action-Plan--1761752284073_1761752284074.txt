# THE 30-DAY MTAADAO CHALLENGE
## From Idea to Active DAO in One Month — A Daily Action Plan

---

**The Promise:**

If you follow this plan for 30 days, by the end you will have:
- A functioning DAO with 10+ active members
- Ksh 10,000+ in the treasury
- Your first investment earning yields
- A governance system that actually works
- Proof that community economics is real

**The Reality:**

Some days will be easy (15 minutes).  
Some days will be hard (2+ hours).  
Some days you'll want to quit.

**But if you make it to Day 30, you'll have built something that can outlive you.**

---

## **THE STRUCTURE**

The challenge is organized into 4 weeks:

| **Week** | **Theme** | **Goal** |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Week 1** | FOUNDATION | Find your people, define your purpose |
| **Week 2** | LAUNCH | Set up the tech, onboard members |
| **Week 3** | ACTIVATION | First contributions, first decisions |
| **Week 4** | MOMENTUM | First investments, first yields, first proof |

Each day has:
- ✅ **Action** (what to do)
- ⏱️ **Time** (realistic estimate)
- 💡 **Why** (the reasoning)
- 🎯 **Success** (how you know you did it right)
- 🚨 **Red Flag** (warning signs)

---

# WEEK 1: FOUNDATION
## *"Gather Your People, Clarify Your Purpose"*

---

### **DAY 1: THE DECISION**
**Theme:** Commit to the challenge

#### ✅ Action:
1. Read Chapter 1 (The Manifesto) out loud to yourself
2. Ask yourself: "Why do I want to do this?"
3. Write down your answer. One paragraph. Handwritten.
4. Take a photo of it. This is your anchor when things get hard.

#### ⏱️ Time: 30 minutes

#### 💡 Why:
You need a *why* stronger than "this sounds cool." You need a reason that will survive the inevitable doubts, the skeptical questions, the moments when organizing people feels impossible.

#### 🎯 Success:
You have a written statement you can read when motivation fades.

#### 🚨 Red Flag:
If your reason is "to make money fast," stop now. MtaaDAO is about building infrastructure, not get-rich-quick schemes.

---

### **DAY 2: THE INNER CIRCLE**
**Theme:** Identify your co-founders

#### ✅ Action:
1. List 20 people you know who might be interested
2. Filter using these criteria:
   - ✅ Have smartphone + M-PESA
   - ✅ Can commit Ksh 500-1,000/month
   - ✅ You'd lend them money
   - ✅ Show up when they say they will
   - ✅ Open to trying new things

3. Narrow to your top 5-10 people
4. Text them: *"I'm starting something. Can I call you about it?"*

#### ⏱️ Time: 1 hour

#### 💡 Why:
A DAO is only as strong as its people. Don't recruit everyone. Recruit the right ones.

#### 🎯 Success:
5-10 people agree to a call.

#### 🚨 Red Flag:
If no one says yes, your network might not be ready. Consider joining an existing DAO first to learn the ropes.

---

### **DAY 3: THE PITCH CALLS**
**Theme:** Enroll your co-founders

#### ✅ Action:
Call each person (10-15 min per call):

**Your script:**
1. "I've been thinking about how we all struggle to save/invest/organize money"
2. "I found a tool that lets us pool money, earn yields, and make decisions together"
3. "It's like a chama, but transparent and automated"
4. "I'm starting one. Would you join me?"

**If they ask questions:**
- "How does it work?" → "It's an app. You send M-PESA, it tracks everything automatically"
- "Is it crypto?" → "Sort of, but you don't need to understand crypto. Just like you use M-PESA without understanding how it works"
- "Is it safe?" → "We'll control it together. No one person can touch the money"

**Close with:**
"We're meeting Sunday at 3 PM to set it up. Can you make it?"

#### ⏱️ Time: 2-3 hours (spread throughout day)

#### 💡 Why:
Enrollment happens in conversation, not via text. You need to hear their concerns and address them live.

#### 🎯 Success:
5+ people commit to the founding meeting.

#### 🚨 Red Flag:
If people are interested but won't commit to a meeting, they're not serious. Move on.

---

### **DAY 4: THE STUDY SESSION**
**Theme:** Educate yourself

#### ✅ Action:
1. Read Chapter 2 (The Architecture) in full
2. Watch MtaaDAO tutorial videos (if available)
3. Write down 3 questions you still have
4. Find answers (FAQ docs, community forum, or email support@mtaadao.com)

#### ⏱️ Time: 1.5 hours

#### 💡 Why:
You'll be the one answering questions. You need to understand the system deeply enough to explain it simply.

#### 🎯 Success:
You can explain how MtaaDAO works in 3 sentences without jargon.

**Example:**
*"We pool money via M-PESA. It goes into a shared wallet we all control. We vote on what to do with it. Everything is tracked transparently."*

#### 🚨 Red Flag:
If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it yet. Keep studying.

---

### **DAY 5: THE AGENDA**
**Theme:** Prepare the founding meeting

#### ✅ Action:
Create the founding meeting agenda (use template from Chapter 3):

**YOUR AGENDA:**
1. **Welcome** (5 min) — Why we're here
2. **Introductions** (10 min) — Everyone shares why they joined
3. **The Pitch** (10 min) — You explain MtaaDAO (use your 3-sentence explanation)
4. **Purpose Discussion** (15 min) — What is this DAO for?
5. **Contribution Plan** (15 min) — How much, how often?
6. **Rules Discussion** (15 min) — Governance, exits, penalties
7. **Charter Signing** (5 min) — Everyone agrees
8. **Next Steps** (5 min) — Tech setup timeline

**Total time:** 90 minutes

Print or share this agenda with attendees *before* the meeting.

#### ⏱️ Time: 1 hour

#### 💡 Why:
A structured meeting builds trust. It shows you're serious and organized.

#### 🎯 Success:
Agenda is clear, time-boxed, shared with all attendees.

#### 🚨 Red Flag:
If you skip this, the meeting will devolve into chaos. Structure = trust.

---

### **DAY 6: THE PREP DAY**
**Theme:** Get logistics ready

#### ✅ Action:
1. **Confirm attendance:** Text everyone: "See you tomorrow 3 PM at [location]?"
2. **Prepare materials:**
   - Print DAO Charter template (1 copy per person)
   - Bring pens
   - Have phone/laptop ready to show MtaaDAO platform
3. **Set up space:**
   - If in-person: Arrange seating in circle (not classroom-style)
   - If virtual: Test Zoom/WhatsApp video link
4. **Mental prep:** Review your "why" from Day 1

#### ⏱️ Time: 1 hour

#### 💡 Why:
Logistics matter. A smooth meeting builds confidence.

#### 🎯 Success:
All confirmed, materials ready, you feel calm.

#### 🚨 Red Flag:
If less than 5 people confirm, reschedule. Don't launch with a weak foundation.

---

### **DAY 7: THE FOUNDING MEETING**
**Theme:** Birth the DAO

#### ✅ Action:
**Run the meeting** (follow Day 5 agenda):

**Key moments:**

**1. Opening (set the tone):**
*"Thank you for being here. What we're about to do is rare. We're choosing to organize our money differently. Not because the old ways are bad, but because we can do better. Let's build something we're proud of."*

**2. Purpose Discussion (critical):**
Don't rush this. Let everyone speak. Common purposes:
- Emergency fund for members
- Investment pool to grow money
- Loan circle for business capital
- Project fund (specific goal: buy land, start business, etc.)

**Clarifying questions:**
- "What problem are we solving?"
- "What does success look like in 1 year?"
- "How will we know this is working?"

**3. Contribution Decision:**
Start conservative. Better to begin with Ksh 500/month and increase later than start with Ksh 2,000 and watch people drop off.

**4. Rules (use this framework):**

| **Rule Type** | **Decision** |
|---------------|--------------|
| Contribution amount | [Ksh X/month] |
| Contribution date | [1st-5th of month] |
| Missed contribution | [Warning → Loss of vote → Exit] |
| Exit process | [30 days notice, get 100% back minus X% fee] |
| Voting threshold | [Simple majority for small, 60% for big decisions] |
| Emergency withdrawals | [Vote required, or 3-of-5 multisig approval] |

**5. Charter Signing:**
Everyone signs physical document. Take photo of group holding it. This is your founding moment.

**6. Close (momentum):**
*"We just did something most people only talk about. The hard part is behind us. Now we execute."*

Set next meeting: 1 week (Day 14) for tech onboarding.

#### ⏱️ Time: 90 minutes (maybe 2 hours if great discussion)

#### 💡 Why:
This is where theory becomes commitment. Signatures make it real.

#### 🎯 Success:
- Everyone signed charter
- Clear agreement on purpose, contributions, rules
- Next meeting scheduled
- Group energy is high

#### 🚨 Red Flags:
- People argue for more than 30 minutes without resolution → table decision, come back in 3 days
- Someone tries to dominate conversation → gently redirect: "Let's hear from everyone"
- People aren't taking it seriously (joking through important decisions) → stop, reset: "This is real money. We need to be serious"

---

**🎉 WEEK 1 CHECKPOINT:**

By end of Day 7, you should have:
- ✅ 5-10 committed co-founders
- ✅ Signed charter with clear rules
- ✅ Agreed contribution amount
- ✅ Defined purpose
- ✅ Next meeting scheduled

**If you don't have these, DO NOT proceed to Week 2. Fix foundation first.**

---

# WEEK 2: LAUNCH
## *"From Paper to Platform"*

---

### **DAY 8: REST & REFLECT**
**Theme:** Integration day

#### ✅ Action:
1. Transcribe founding charter into digital document
2. Share with all members via WhatsApp/email
3. Create DAO WhatsApp group (if not already exists)
4. Share photo of group from founding meeting
5. Message: *"This is what we built. Week 2: we make it digital."*

#### ⏱️ Time: 30 minutes

#### 💡 Why:
Pause to let the commitment sink in. Reinforce what you achieved.

#### 🎯 Success:
Everyone has charter, sees the photo, feels part of something.

---

### **DAY 9: PLATFORM ACCOUNT SETUP**
**Theme:** Get on the tech

#### ✅ Action:
1. Go to **app.mtaadao.com** (or platform URL)
2. Create your personal account:
   - Phone number verification
   - Set profile (name, photo)
   - Complete onboarding tutorial
3. Explore dashboard (even though you don't have a DAO yet)
4. Screenshot key screens
5. Share in WhatsApp: *"This is what we'll use. Looks simple, right?"*

#### ⏱️ Time: 30 minutes

#### 💡 Why:
You need to experience the user flow before guiding others through it.

#### 🎯 Success:
You're comfortable navigating platform, can anticipate questions.

#### 🚨 Red Flag:
If platform is confusing to you (and you're motivated), it'll be 10x harder for skeptical members. Reach out to support for help.

---

### **DAY 10: CREATE THE DAO**
**Theme:** Deploy the smart contract

#### ✅ Action:
1. On platform, click **"Create New DAO"**
2. Fill in details:
   - DAO Name: [Your name from charter]
   - Purpose: [Your purpose statement]
   - Contribution amount: [Ksh X]
   - Contribution frequency: [Monthly]
   - Member cap: [10-20 to start]
   - Governance model: [Choose template, e.g., "Simple Majority"]

3. Review settings
4. Click **"Deploy DAO"** → Smart contract gets created (happens automatically)
5. You'll get:
   - DAO dashboard URL
   - Invite link
   - Treasury wallet address

6. Screenshot everything
7. Share in group: *"It's live. Here's our DAO."*

#### ⏱️ Time: 45 minutes

#### 💡 Why:
This is the bridge from idea to infrastructure. The DAO now *exists* on blockchain.

#### 🎯 Success:
- DAO deployed
- You have invite link
- Members can see it's real

#### 🚨 Red Flag:
If deployment fails (technical error), don't panic. Contact support. Usually resolved in 24 hours.

---

### **DAY 11: MEMBER ONBOARDING (PART 1)**
**Theme:** Get half the group on platform

#### ✅ Action:
1. Send invite link to 5 members (don't overwhelm yourself)
2. Message: *"Click this link. Takes 10 min. I'll call you to walk through it if needed."*
3. Be available for calls/help throughout day
4. Track who completes onboarding (check DAO dashboard)

**Common issues you'll troubleshoot:**
- "I didn't get SMS code" → Check number, try again
- "I don't understand wallet" → "Ignore that for now, just click next"
- "Where's my money going?" → "It's not asking for money yet, just setting up account"

#### ⏱️ Time: 2-3 hours (helping members)

#### 💡 Why:
Onboarding is the hardest part. This is where you earn your leadership.

#### 🎯 Success:
5 members successfully onboarded, showing up in DAO member list.

#### 🚨 Red Flag:
If 0 members complete after your help, the platform might be too complex. Escalate to MtaaDAO support for simplified flow or consider waiting for v2.

---

### **DAY 12: MEMBER ONBOARDING (PART 2)**
**Theme:** Get everyone else on platform

#### ✅ Action:
1. Send invite link to remaining members
2. Host 30-min video call: "Onboarding Office Hours"
   - Everyone joins
   - You screen-share, walk through step-by-step
   - They follow along in real-time
3. By end of call, everyone should be onboarded

#### ⏱️ Time: 1 hour

#### 💡 Why:
Group onboarding is faster than 1-on-1. Plus it builds camaraderie.

#### 🎯 Success:
10/10 members (or your target number) showing up in DAO dashboard.

#### 🚨 Red Flag:
If 2+ members ghost (don't respond, don't onboard), accept they're not serious. Proceed with who you have. You can add members later.

---

### **DAY 13: M-PESA INTEGRATION**
**Theme:** Connect payment rails

#### ✅ Action:
1. Platform provides DAO-specific Paybill/Till number
2. Share in WhatsApp:
   - *"Our DAO Paybill: [Number]"*
   - *"Account number: Your phone number"*
   - *"When you send, money goes directly to our shared treasury"*

3. Demo it yourself:
   - Send Ksh 10 test transaction
   - Show how it appears in treasury dashboard
   - Screenshot & share

4. Announce: *"First real contributions: Day 15 (in 2 days). Amount: Ksh [X]. Let's go."*

#### ⏱️ Time: 30 minutes

#### 💡 Why:
Seeing money flow in real-time is when MtaaDAO clicks from "interesting idea" to "holy shit, this works."

#### 🎯 Success:
Members understand how to contribute, test transaction successful.

---

### **DAY 14: PRE-LAUNCH CALL**
**Theme:** Final prep before contributions

#### ✅ Action:
Host 30-min call (your Week 1 follow-up meeting):

**Agenda:**
1. **Celebration** (5 min) — "We're all onboarded. That's rare. Most groups don't get this far."
2. **Dashboard tour** (10 min) — Show everyone:
   - Where to see treasury balance
   - Where to see their contribution history
   - Where votes will appear
3. **Contribution reminder** (5 min) — "Tomorrow, Day 15, we all contribute Ksh [X]"
4. **First proposal preview** (5 min) — "Once we have Ksh 10K in treasury, we'll vote on first investment"
5. **Questions** (5 min)

**Close:**
*"Tomorrow is the real test. If we all follow through, we prove to ourselves that we're different. That we can build something solid. See you on the other side."*

#### ⏱️ Time: 30 minutes

#### 💡 Why:
This call builds anticipation and accountability. Everyone knows tomorrow matters.

#### 🎯 Success:
Everyone clear on next steps, energy is high.

---

**🎉 WEEK 2 CHECKPOINT:**

By end of Day 14, you should have:
- ✅ DAO deployed on platform
- ✅ All members onboarded
- ✅ M-PESA connected
- ✅ First contribution date set (Day 15)

**If onboarding took longer, that's fine. Extend timeline. Don't rush.**

---

# WEEK 3: ACTIVATION
## *"From Treasury to Action"*

---

### **DAY 15: FIRST CONTRIBUTIONS**
**Theme:** The moment of truth

#### ✅ Action:
1. **Morning message:** *"Today's the day. Paybill: [X]. Amount: Ksh [X]. Let's do this."*

2. **Lead by example:** Be first to contribute. Screenshot confirmation. Share immediately.

3. **Track in real-time:** Watch dashboard as contributions come in

4. **Celebrate each one:** When someone contributes, acknowledge in group:
   - *"✅ Jane just contributed! 2/10 in."*
   - *"✅ John in! 5/10. Halfway there!"*

5. **End of day:** Send summary:
   - *"9/10 members contributed. Treasury: Ksh 9,000. [Name], we're waiting on you. Tomorrow?"*

#### ⏱️ Time: Monitoring throughout day (10-15 min per check-in)

#### 💡 Why:
Public accountability drives action. Seeing progress motivates stragglers.

#### 🎯 Success:
80%+ contribute on Day 15. 100% by Day 16.

#### 🚨 Red Flags:
- Less than 50% contribute → re-evaluate commitment. Have 1-on-1 calls with non-contributors
- Someone says "I thought we were starting next month" → communication failure. Your fault. Fix it.

---

### **DAY 16: THE FIRST $1,000 MOMENT**
**Theme:** Cross the threshold

#### ✅ Action:
1. **Chase any stragglers:** Personal calls, not group pressure
2. **When last contribution comes in:**
   - Screenshot treasury showing Ksh 10K+ (or your target)
   - Share with message: *"We did it. Ksh 10,000. Organized. Transparent. Ours. This is just the beginning."*

3. **Schedule First Proposal Discussion** for Day 19 (give 3 days for research)

4. **Announce:** *"Friday: We vote on our first investment. Between now and then, think about: Do we want to earn yields immediately (DeFi 5-6%), or keep liquid for now? I'll share options on Day 18."*

#### ⏱️ Time: 1 hour

#### 💡 Why:
This is a psychological milestone. Ksh 10K feels real. Now people see: "Oh, this isn't theoretical."

#### 🎯 Success:
Full treasury, excitement palpable, first vote imminent.

---

### **DAY 17: EDUCATION DAY**
**Theme:** Demystify DeFi

#### ✅ Action:
**Create simple explainer for members:**

**WhatsApp Message:**
*"Since we're voting on investment soon, here's a quick explainer:*

**Option 1: Keep Cash (0% yield)**
- ✅ Safe, liquid
- ❌ Losing to inflation (~6%/year)

**Option 2: DeFi Savings (5-6% APY)**
- ✅ Better than banks (most give 3-4%)
- ✅ Withdraw anytime
- ❌ Requires trusting smart contracts
- How it works: We lend our stablecoins to protocols like Aave. Borrowers pay interest. We earn that interest.

**Option 3: Money Market Fund via API (7-8% APY)**
- ✅ Familiar (it's what Kenyans already use)
- ✅ Slightly higher returns
- ❌ May require KYC

**My recommendation: Start with Option 2. Safe, simple, better than doing nothing.**

*What do you think? Reply with questions. We vote Friday."*

#### ⏱️ Time: 1 hour (crafting message, answering questions)

#### 💡 Why:
Informed voters make better decisions. This prevents "I don't understand so I won't vote."

#### 🎯 Success:
Members ask questions, engage with options.

---

### **DAY 18: PROPOSAL SUBMISSION**
**Theme:** Formalize the vote

#### ✅ Action:
1. On platform, click **"New Proposal"**
2. Fill in:
   - **Title:** "Invest 80% of treasury in Aave USDC lending"
   - **Description:**
     - *"We have Ksh 10,000 sitting idle. I propose we invest Ksh 8,000 (80%) into Aave, a DeFi protocol that pays ~5.5% APY on stablecoins."*
     - *"Why Aave: Audited, $10B+ locked, been around since 2020, no hacks."*
     - *"Risk: Smart contract risk (low but not zero). If Aave gets hacked, we could lose funds."*
     - *"Keeps Ksh 2,000 liquid for any urgent needs."*
     - *"Expected return: Ksh 440/year. Not life-changing, but better than nothing."*
   - **Vote duration:** 48 hours
   - **Execution:** Auto (if passes, smart contract moves funds)

3. Submit → Proposal goes live

4. Announce in WhatsApp: *"Proposal is live. Link: [X]. Discussion open now. Vote opens tomorrow."*

#### ⏱️ Time: 30 minutes

#### 💡 Why:
Formal proposals create clarity and accountability.

#### 🎯 Success:
Proposal clear, members understand what they're voting on.

---

### **DAY 19: VOTE DAY (Discussion)**
**Theme:** Deliberate before deciding

#### ✅ Action:
1. **Morning:** *"Voting opens in 24 hours. Today is for questions."*

2. **Be available:** Answer questions throughout day:
   - "What if we need the money?" → *"That's why we're keeping 20% liquid"*
   - "Can we withdraw anytime?" → *"Yes, from Aave we can withdraw same day"*
   - "What if it fails?" → *"We lose that investment. But historically Aave is very safe"*

3. **Evening:** *"Last call for questions. Tomorrow we vote."*

#### ⏱️ Time: 1-2 hours (spread throughout day)

#### 💡 Why:
Good governance = informed decisions. Rushing votes kills trust.

#### 🎯 Success:
No one says "I don't understand."

---

### **DAY 20: VOTE DAY (Execution)**
**Theme:** First democratic decision

#### ✅ Action:
1. **Morning:** *"Voting is live. You have 24 hours. Link: [X]"*

2. **Track participation:** Dashboard shows who voted

3. **Mid-day reminder:** *"5/10 voted so far. If you haven't, now's the time."*

4. **Evening final call:** *"4 hours left. Your vote matters."*

5. **End of day:** Vote closes automatically. Results announced:
   - *"Results: 8 Yes, 1 No, 1 Abstain. Proposal PASSED."*
   - *"Smart contract is executing. Funds moving to Aave now."*

6. **Screenshot:** Treasury dashboard showing:
   - Ksh 8,000 invested in Aave
   - Ksh 2,000 liquid
   - First yield accruing

7. **Share:** *"We just made our first investment as a DAO. Welcome to the new economy."*

#### ⏱️ Time: Monitoring throughout day

#### 💡 Why:
This is the magic. Voting → Automatic execution. No treasurer, no delay. Just code.

#### 🎯 Success:
- High turnout (80%+)
- Proposal executes smoothly
- Members see yields start appearing

#### 🚨 Red Flag:
Low turnout (<50%) → Investigate why. Apathy? Confusion? Address before next vote.

---

### **DAY 21: YIELD WATCH**
**Theme:** See money grow

#### ✅ Action:
1. **Morning message:** *"Check the dashboard. Our Ksh 8,000 is now earning. Watch the number go up."*

2. **Explain:** *"Every day, you'll see treasury increase by ~Ksh 1-2. That's yield. It's small daily, but compounds over time."*

3. **Math breakdown:**
   - Ksh 8,000 at 5.5% APY = Ksh 440/year
   - Daily: Ksh 1.20
   - Monthly: Ksh 36

4. **Set expectation:** *"We won't get rich overnight. But we're building wealth, together, transparently."*

5. **Celebrate:** *"Most chamas earn 0% on idle cash. We're already better."*

#### ⏱️ Time: 30 minutes

#### 💡 Why:
Seeing growth, even small, reinforces the model works.

#### 🎯 Success:
Members check dashboard, comment on yield, feel momentum.

---

**🎉 WEEK 3 CHECKPOINT:**

By end of Day 21, you should have:
- ✅ Ksh 10K+ in treasury
- ✅ First investment made
- ✅ Yields accruing
- ✅ Members engaged in governance

**This is proof of concept. You did it.**

---

# WEEK 4: MOMENTUM
## *"From Proof to Pattern"*

---

### **DAY 22: SECOND CONTRIBUTION WINDOW**
**Theme:** Build the rhythm

#### ✅ Action:
1. **Announce:** *"Contribution window opens today. This is now our rhythm: 1st week of every month."*

2. **Make it easy:** *"Same Paybill, same amount. Let's keep the momentum."*

3. **Track & celebrate:** Use same pattern as Day 15

#### ⏱️ Time: 15 minutes (mostly automated now)

#### 💡 Why:
Consistency builds the habit. Second contribution is harder than first (novelty wore off). Push through.

#### 🎯 Success:
80%+ contribute again. You're building a pattern.

#### 🚨 Red Flag:
Drop-off >50% → Call emergency meeting. Something's wrong (maybe contribution too high, maybe losing faith). Diagnose and fix.

---

### **DAY 23: FIRST LOAN PROPOSAL**
**Theme:** Put money to use

#### ✅ Action:
**If someone needs a loan:**
1. They submit proposal:
   - Amount, purpose, repayment plan, interest rate
2. DAO discusses (Day 23-24)
3. Votes (Day 25)

**If no one needs loan yet:**
1. Skip to Day 26
2. Or propose second investment (diversify into Money Market Fund?)

**Example loan proposal:**
*"I need Ksh 5,000 to restock my shop. I'll repay Ksh 600/month for 9 months (total Ksh 5,400 = 8% interest). I've contributed for 2 months consistently. If I miss payment, deduct from my future contributions."*

#### ⏱️ Time: 1 hour (if loan needed)

#### 💡 Why:
Loans prove utility. This isn't just savings; it's productive capital.

#### 🎯 Success:

### **DAY 25: FIRST YIELD DISTRIBUTION VOTE**
**Theme:** Decide what to do with earnings

#### ✅ Action:
**Treasury now has:**
- Original Ksh 18,000 (2 months contributions)
- +Ksh 40 (yield from 5 days)

**Proposal:**
*"We've earned Ksh 40 in yield. What should we do with it?"*

**Options:**
A) Reinvest (compound)
B) Split proportionally (Ksh 4 each to 10 members)
C) Hold for future opportunity

**Vote.**

**Likely outcome:** A (reinvest). It's too small to distribute meaningfully.

But asking the question = good governance practice.

#### ⏱️ Time: 30 minutes

#### 💡 Why:
Teaches governance rhythm. Not every vote is high-stakes, but every vote matters.

#### 🎯 Success:
Members engage even on small decisions.

### **DAY 26: PLANNING META-DAO CONNECTION**
**Theme:** Think bigger

#### ✅ Action:
**Research:**
1. Are there other DAOs in your city/region?
2. Is there a meta-DAO you can join?
3. If not, could you help start one (in 6 months)?

**Share with group:**
*"Long-term vision: Once we hit Ksh 100K treasury, we can connect with other DAOs to access bigger investments. That's 6-12 months away. For now, let's keep building."*

#### ⏱️ Time: 1 hour

#### 💡 Why:
Paints the bigger picture. You're not just a small group; you're part of a movement.

#### 🎯 Success:
Members see the scaling potential.
