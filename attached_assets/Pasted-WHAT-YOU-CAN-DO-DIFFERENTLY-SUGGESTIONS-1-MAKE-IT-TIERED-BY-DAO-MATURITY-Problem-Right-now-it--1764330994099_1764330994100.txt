WHAT YOU CAN DO DIFFERENTLY - SUGGESTIONS
1. MAKE IT TIERED BY DAO MATURITY
Problem: Right now it's one flat system
Solution: Different reward rates for different DAO stages
New DAOs (0-3 months): Higher referral rewards to bootstrap
Mature DAOs (1+ years): Lower referral rates, focus on retention
This incentivizes growing young DAOs while preventing over-dilution in old ones
2. ADD CONTRIBUTION-BASED TIERS
Current: Fixed 20 cUSD per signup
Better: Reward based on referred user's contribution level
Referred user contributes $100 → You get 5%
Referred user contributes $1,000 → You get 7.5%
Referred user contributes $10,000 → You get 10%
This ties reward to actual ecosystem value creation, not just head count
3. IMPLEMENT REFERRAL CHAINS (Multi-level)
Current: Only 1 level (you refer someone)
Better: 2-3 level system like traditional MLM but sustainable
You refer Alice → You earn 10%
Alice refers Bob → You earn 3% (tier 2 bonus)
Bob refers Charlie → You earn 1% (tier 3 bonus)
Encourages network effect without becoming predatory
4. TIME-BASED BONUSES
Current: All referrals equal
Better: Longevity rewards
Referred user stays active for 1 month → You get 1x reward
Referred user stays active for 6 months → You get 1.5x reward
Referred user stays active for 1 year → You get 2x reward
Prevents spam referrals; rewards real community building
5. DAO-SPECIFIC REFERRAL POOLS
Current: One global leaderboard
Better: Each DAO has its own referral pool
DAO gets to set referral rewards amount
Aligns incentives with DAO growth
Example: A startup DAO might offer 50 MTAA/referral, but established DAO offers 5 MTAA/referral
6. REFERRAL BADGES & ACHIEVEMENTS
"Ambassador" - Successfully referred 10+ active members
"Evangelist" - $10K+ total contribution value from referrals
"Network Builder" - Referred members who went on to refer others
These unlock special perks (commission bumps, voting power, exclusive features)
7. ANTI-GAMING MECHANISMS
Current: No real protection against referral fraud
Better: Add checks like:
Same wallet address can't be referred twice
Referrer & referred user can't transfer between same wallets for X days
Bot detection on referral patterns
KYC requirement for payouts above $1,000
8. VIRAL INCENTIVE STRUCTURE
Current: Individual rewards
Better: "Shared success" bonuses
If your referred users collectively hit $100K in contributions this month, you ALL get 20% bonus
Creates team mentality, not just individual competition
MY ASSESSMENT
Your system is solid but too simple for a Kenyan chama-based DAO ecosystem. Here's why:

In real chamas:

Founders recruit members actively
Members bring other members
Trust compounds over time
Long-term commitment = higher status
Shared goals create loyalty
What your system misses:

No incentive for referred user to stay (just signup reward)
No network effect (single level only)
No recognition for "brought the strongest members"
No protection against abuse
If I were redesigning it for Kenya:

Make it a "Founder's Circle" - The person who brought in the most quality, long-term members gets special DAO governance rights (elder status, bonus voting power)
Add "Milestone Celebrations" - When 10 people from your referral tree hit certain goals together, everyone gets rewarded
Create "Referral Seasons" - Like football seasons, each quarter has a different referral challenge with different rules
This would transform it from "get paid to spam links" into "build your community and share in its success" - much more aligned with Kenyan values!
