Critical Confusion Points
4 issues
What IS a DAO?
Impact: High - Users might create something without understanding the commitment
Current state:

Form jumps straight into 'What type of group is this?'

💭 Wait, what am I creating? Is this just a group chat? A savings account?

✅ Recommendation:

Add a 30-second explainer: 'A DAO is a digital group with a shared wallet that uses blockchain to track contributions and decisions. Think of it like a chama, but with automatic record-keeping that no one can change.'

Blockchain = Permanent
Impact: High - Users might deploy test DAOs they can't remove
Current state:

Small note: 'This action cannot be undone' only appears at Step 7

💭 Can I delete this later if I made a mistake?

✅ Recommendation:

Add persistent warning badge throughout: '⚠️ Permanent - Cannot delete once deployed'

What are 'Elders' really?
Impact: High - Trust is critical in financial groups
Current state:

Shows checkboxes and bullet points about permissions

💭 So... they're like admins? Or more like the WhatsApp group admin? Can they steal money?

✅ Recommendation:

Add real-world analogy: 'Like table banking signatories - they can't withdraw alone, but they approve when the group decides to spend money. You need 2-3 elders to approve any withdrawal.'

Governance confusion
Impact: High - Wrong choice could cause group conflicts
Current state:

Shows '1-person-1-vote' vs 'weighted-stake' without context

💭 Which one should I pick? Will people think I'm trying to control things?

✅ Recommendation:

Add scenario examples: '1-person-1-vote: Everyone has equal say (Good for burial funds, community groups) | Weighted: Those who contribute more have more say (Good for investment clubs)'

Medium Confusion Points
4 issues
Treasury types are technical
Impact: Medium - Could lead to poor financial choices
Current state:

cUSD, CELO, Dual Treasury

💭 What even is cUSD? Is this like M-Pesa? Which is safer?

✅ Recommendation:

Add plain language: 'cUSD = Digital dollars (stable, like M-Pesa) | CELO = Can grow or shrink in value (like stocks) | Dual = Mix of both'

Multisig sounds scary
Impact: Medium - Might disable important security feature
Current state:

Technical explanation with 'signers' and 'required signatures'

💭 Is this about signing documents? Do I need to print something?

✅ Recommendation:

Rename to 'Group Approval' and explain: 'Requires 2-3 trusted members to approve withdrawals (like needing multiple keys to open a safe)'

Peer invite system
Impact: Medium - Users might not leverage the trust mechanism
Current state:

Mentions it exists but not WHY it matters

💭 Why can't I just share a link with everyone?

✅ Recommendation:

Explain trust network: 'Members you add can invite others they trust. This creates accountability - if someone misbehaves, we know who invited them.'

Quorum percentage
Impact: Medium - Wrong setting could paralyze the DAO
Current state:

Shows slider with 20-100%

💭 Is 50% too high? What if people don't vote?

✅ Recommendation:

Add real examples: 'If you have 20 members and set 50% quorum, you need 10 votes for decisions to pass. Higher = safer but slower decisions.'

Missing Context
3 issues
What happens after deployment?
Impact: Medium - Users might feel lost after creation
Current state:

Success screen with buttons but no explanation

💭 Now what? Do people get notified? Can I change things?

✅ Recommendation:

Add post-deployment guide: 'Next steps: 1) Share invite links 2) Wait for members to join 3) First members can start proposals'

Cost implications
Impact: Medium - Unexpected costs erode trust
Current state:

No mention of costs until deployment

💭 Is this going to cost me money? Transaction fees?

✅ Recommendation:

Add cost transparency upfront: 'Free tier: No cost to create | Transaction fees: Small gas fees when moving money (typically <$0.01)'

Time commitments
Impact: Low-Medium - Prevents founder burnout
Current state:

Shows voting periods but not ongoing maintenance

💭 How much time do I need to manage this?

✅ Recommendation:

Set expectations: 'As founder, expect 30min/week: reviewing proposals, approving withdrawals, resolving disputes'

Jargon Alert
2 issues
Technical terms without translation
Impact: Low - But cumulative effect makes form intimidating
Current state:

Treasury, Governance, Quorum, Deployment, Multisig, Weighted-stake

💭 I feel dumb asking what these mean...

✅ Recommendation:

Always pair technical terms with plain language in parentheses throughout

'Deploy' sounds military
Impact: Low - Psychological barrier
Current state:

Big 'Deploy DAO' button

💭 Deploy? Like soldiers? Can't we just 'Create' it?

✅ Recommendation:

Use 'Create Your Group' or 'Launch Your DAO' - softer language

💡 Validation Strategy
Run these tests before launch:

Grandmother test: Can someone with zero tech knowledge complete it with a friend reading the instructions?
5-second test: Show each step for 5 seconds - can users describe what it's asking?
Think-aloud protocol: Watch 5 users fill it out while speaking their thoughts
Confusion rate: Track where users spend >2 minutes on a step (indicates confusion)
Support tickets: What questions come up most in first 2 weeks?
