PROPOSED DAO TREASURY FLOWS 💡
1. DAO-Specific Achievement Rewards
When a DAO hits milestones, the DAO treasury receives MTAA (not individual users):

Examples:

DAO reaches 50 active members → Treasury +500 MTAA
DAO treasury reaches $10K → Treasury +1000 MTAA
DAO completes first proposal successfully → Treasury +200 MTAA
DAO member referral chain (someone refers someone who joins) → 10% of that user's MTAA reward goes to DAO treasury
DAO hits 100 total contributions → Treasury +2000 MTAA
2. Revenue Share to DAO Treasury
When users earn MTAA through the DAO ecosystem, the DAO gets a cut:

Example structure:

User contributes $100 to DAO
→ User earns 50 MTAA
→ DAO treasury gets 5-10% (2.5-5 MTAA) [platform rake]
→ Remaining 45-47.5 MTAA go to user

3. Task Reward Pool Allocation
When a DAO creator posts a task:

Task reward: 100 MTAA
→ User completes task: Gets 100 MTAA ✓
→ If task is "fund this activity": 20% goes to DAO treasury
→ Example: Fund project → 20 MTAA to treasury, 80 MTAA to completer

4. Governance Participation Tax (Optional)
When users vote on DAO proposals:

Voting reward: 1 MTAA per vote
→ User gets: 0.8 MTAA
→ DAO treasury gets: 0.2 MTAA (platform reinvestment)

5. Membership Tier System
Premium membership could have DAO benefits:

User buys "DAO Insider" tier: 50 MTAA
→ User gets benefits/rewards
→ DAO treasury: 20 MTAA (if user joined via DAO invitation)

ARCHITECTURE NEEDED IN YOUR SYSTEM
Three New Tables:
dao_treasury_credits - Track what triggers treasury MTAA

id, daoId, source (achievement, referral_rake, task_pool, etc)
amount, reason, createdAt
mtaa_distribution_rules - Define how much goes where

id, daoId, action_type (contribution, referral, task, vote)
user_percentage, dao_percentage, platform_percentage
Example: 70% user, 20% DAO, 10% platform
dao_achievement_milestones - DAO-level achievements

id, daoId, type (member_count, treasury_value, proposal_success)
threshold, mtaa_reward, completed_at
