## Feature Priority Matrix by Phase

### Phase 1: MVP (What MUST work)

```
CRITICAL (if fails = don't launch):
├─ Create DAO
├─ Invite members
├─ Connect wallet
├─ View treasury
├─ Create & vote on proposals
├─ Execute approved proposals
└─ Transaction history

IMPORTANT (should work, but can fix post-launch):
├─ Beautiful UI/UX
├─ Mobile responsive
├─ Advanced reporting
└─ Integrations

CAN SKIP (Phase 2+):
├─ Locked savings
├─ Investment pools
├─ Advanced governance
├─ Automation
└─ Anything not in CRITICAL
```

### Phase 2: Revenue (What drives money)

```
CRITICAL:
├─ Locked savings (interest calculation MUST be correct)
├─ Investment pools (capital tracking MUST be accurate)
├─ Escrow (funds MUST be safe)
└─ Payment processing

IMPORTANT:
├─ Advanced features (nice to have)
├─ UI polish
└─ Reporting

CAN SKIP:
├─ Fancy animations
├─ Advanced filters
└─ Mobile-specific features
```

### Phase 3-6: Optimization

```
Features added in order of:
1. User value (what helps users most?)
2. Business value (what makes money?)
3. Differentiation (what makes us unique?)
4. Technical feasibility (can we build it?)
5. Team capacity (do we have people?)

Skip everything else until these are answered.

## Managing Across All 24 Months

### How to Not Lose Your Mind

```
WEEKLY CADENCE:
├─ Monday: Week planning standup (1h)
├─ Tuesday-Thursday: Execution
├─ Friday: Demo day + retrospective (2h)
└─ Clear priorities for next week

MONTHLY CADENCE:
├─ Week 1: Planning phase features (2h)
├─ Weeks 2-3: Execution
├─ Week 4: Retrospective + forecast (2h)
└─ Update roadmap if needed

QUARTERLY CADENCE:
├─ Full company review (half-day)
├─ Phase evaluation (on track?)
├─ Resource allocation for next quarter
├─ Long-term strategy check
└─ Investor/board updates

KEY PRINCIPLE:
"Stick to the plan unless something breaks."

Don't add new features mid-phase.
Don't delay phases without good reason.
Don't launch incomplete features.
```

### How to Handle Delays

```
IF ONE FEATURE IS 2 WEEKS BEHIND:
└─ Decide: Ship without it, or delay phase?

SHIP WITHOUT IT if:
✅ Not critical to users
✅ Doesn't block next phase
✅ Can be added in next phase
✅ Other features compensate for value

DELAY PHASE if:
❌ Feature is critical (broken if missing)
❌ User experience severely impacted
❌ Revenue impact
❌ Security/compliance issue

RULE OF THUMB:
Better to launch 80% of features on time,
than 100% of features 2 months late.
```
