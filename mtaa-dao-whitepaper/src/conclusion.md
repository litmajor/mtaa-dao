## The Transformation Journey

### From Traditional to Decentralized

```rust
/// Evolution of community finance
pub struct FinancialEvolution {
    /// Where we started
    traditional_chama: TraditionalModel {
        ledger: "Paper books, manual entries",
        treasury: "Single treasurer, trust-based",
        governance: "Monthly meetings, hand votes",
        reach: "Local members only",
        transparency: "Minimal, delayed",
    },
    
    /// Where we're going
    mtaa_dao: ModernModel {
        ledger: "Blockchain, immutable history",
        treasury: "Multi-sig vaults, smart contracts",
        governance: "24/7 voting, mobile participation",
        reach: "Global diaspora included",
        transparency: "Real-time, complete",
    },
    
    /// The bridge
    transition: TransitionPath {
        respect: "Honor traditional structures (elders, reputation)",
