# Problem Statement

## The Challenge of Traditional Community Finance

```rust
/// Traditional Community Finance Model
struct TraditionalChama {
    /// Physical ledger book
    ledger: PaperLedger,
    
    /// Single person controlling funds
    treasurer: SingleTreasurer,
    
    /// Monthly in-person meetings
    meeting_frequency: Duration::days(30),
    
    /// Manual vote counting
    voting: ManualVoting,
    
    /// Limited to local members
    member_reach: GeographicBoundary,
}

/// Resulting Problems
enum CriticalIssue {
    /// Trust deficit
    LackOfTransparency {
        cause: "Manual record keeping",
        impact: "Disputes over balances and transactions",
        frequency: "Common",
    },
    
    /// Centralization risk
    SinglePointOfFailure {
        cause: "One person controls funds",
        impact: "Fraud, mismanagement, or loss",
        examples: vec![
            "Treasurer absconds with funds",
            "Poor investment decisions",
            "Lack of accountability",
        ],
    },
    
    /// Inefficiency
    SlowProcesses {
        cause: "Manual, in-person processes",
        impact: "Delayed decisions, missed opportunities",
        example: "Waiting 30 days for next meeting to approve urgent loan",
    },
    
    /// Limited participation
    GeographicConstraints {
        cause: "Physical meeting requirement",
        impact: "Excludes remote workers, diaspora",
        lost_opportunity: "Can't tap into global Kenyan diaspora savings",
    },
}
```

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: The Missing Funds

```rust
/// Common chama fraud scenario
struct ChamaFraudCase {
    initial_balance: Decimal::new(500_000, 0), // KES 500,000
    treasurer_access: AccessLevel::Full,
    oversight: Option<AuditTrail>, // None
    
    /// What happened
    incident: Incident {
        action: "Treasurer withdraws funds",
        amount: Decimal::new(200_000, 0),
        justification: "Investment opportunity",
        verification: None, // No proof required
        outcome: "Funds never recovered",
    },
    
    /// Impact
    consequences: vec![
        "Member trust destroyed",
        "Group disbands",
        "Legal costs exceed recovered amount",
        "Other chamas remain vulnerable",
    ],
}
```

### Scenario 2: The Excluded Diaspora

```rust
/// Diaspora member trying to participate
struct DiasporaMember {
    location: "London, UK",
    home_community: "Nairobi, Kenya",
    
    /// Participation barriers
    challenges: vec![
        Challenge {
            issue: "Can't attend physical meetings",
            impact: "No voting rights",
        },
        Challenge {
            issue: "Can't contribute to chama",
            impact: "Excluded from group savings",
        },
        Challenge {
            issue: "No visibility into funds",
            impact: "Can't verify group health",
        },
    ],
    
    /// Potential contribution
    monthly_capacity: Decimal::new(10_000, 0), // KES 10k/month
    potential_annual: Decimal::new(120_000, 0), // Lost opportunity
}
```

### Scenario 3: The Delayed Decision

```rust
/// Time-sensitive opportunity
struct UrgentOpportunity {
    /// Land sale at 20% discount
    opportunity: RealEstateInvestment {
        value: Decimal::new(2_000_000, 0),
        discount: Percent::new(20),
        window: Duration::days(7), // Must decide in 1 week
    },
    
    /// Chama constraints
    decision_process: TraditionalProcess {
        next_meeting: Duration::days(21), // 3 weeks away
        quorum_required: 15, // out of 20 members
        manual_vote_count: true,
        notification_method: "Phone calls", // Slow
    },
    
    /// Outcome
    result: OpportunityLost {
        reason: "Couldn't convene meeting in time",
        cost: Decimal::new(400_000, 0), // Missed 20% discount
    },
}
```

## The Call for Change

The traditional chama model, while culturally significant, is fundamentally broken in the digital age. MtaaDAO addresses these systemic issues through:

1. **Blockchain transparency** - Immutable, auditable records
2. **Smart contract automation** - Trustless execution
3. **Mobile-first design** - Accessible anywhere
4. **Democratic governance** - Fair, inclusive decision-making
5. **DeFi integration** - Yield generation and financial growth

---

_The problem is clear. The solution is MtaaDAO._
