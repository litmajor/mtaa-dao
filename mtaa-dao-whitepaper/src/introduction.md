# Introduction

**MtaaDAO** is a decentralized autonomous organization platform designed for African communities, enabling transparent governance, collaborative decision-making, and community-driven financial management.

## What is MtaaDAO?

```rust
/// Core DAO Entity
/// 
/// Represents a decentralized autonomous organization
/// with governance, treasury, and member management capabilities.
struct DAO {
    /// Unique identifier for the DAO
    id: Uuid,
    
    /// Human-readable name
    name: String,
    
    /// DAO governance configuration
    governance: GovernanceConfig,
    
    /// Treasury management
    treasury: TreasuryVault,
    
    /// Member registry
    members: Vec<Member>,
    
    /// Creation timestamp
    created_at: DateTime<Utc>,
}

/// Governance Configuration
struct GovernanceConfig {
    /// Minimum percentage of votes needed to pass
    quorum_threshold: u8,  // e.g., 51
    
    /// Voting duration in seconds
    voting_period: u64,
    
    /// Governance model type
    model: GovernanceModel,
}

enum GovernanceModel {
    /// One member, one vote
    Democratic,
    
    /// Votes weighted by token holdings
    TokenWeighted,
    
    /// Votes weighted by reputation score
    ReputationWeighted,
    
    /// Square root of token balance (prevents whale dominance)
    Quadratic,
}
```

## Platform Architecture

```rust
/// High-level system components
mod mtaa_dao {
    /// Blockchain layer (Celo network)
    pub mod blockchain {
        pub use smart_contracts::*;
        pub use vault_system::*;
    }
    
    /// Backend services
    pub mod services {
        pub use governance::*;
        pub use treasury::*;
        pub use reputation::*;
    }
    
    /// Frontend application
    pub mod client {
        pub use wallet::*;
        pub use dao_management::*;
        pub use analytics::*;
    }
}
```
