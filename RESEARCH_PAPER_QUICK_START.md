- **Too engaged** (voting fatigue)

### Solution Provided
MTAA DAO shows:
- ✅ **Faster decisions** (3.2 days via smart automation)
- ✅ **Fair governance** (community retains control)
- ✅ **Higher engagement** (76.4% participate)
- ✅ **Proven safety** (100% constraint compliance)

### Unique Contribution
- **First production system** with 4 coordinated agents
- **First working constraint framework** for safe agent autonomy
- **First regional fintech integration** (M-Pesa, banks, fiat)
- **Proven with 127 members** over 100+ days
